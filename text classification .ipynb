Paradoxically, barely one-third\\n of Transcaucasia\\'s Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the \\n Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan\\n uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians\\n as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897,\\n however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the\\n guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000\\n inhabitants. This impressive change in the province\\'s ethnic character \\n notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian \\n Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the \\n southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.\" \\n (See also Map 1.

The main legal principles of the Turkish State \\nare summarized in Article 2 of the Constitution:\\n\\n\\t\"The Republic of Turkey is a democratic, secular and social State\\n\\tgoverned by the rule of law; bearing in mind the concepts of public\\n\\tpeace, national solidarity and justice; respecting human rights;\\n\\tloyal to the nationalism of Ataturk, and based on the fundamental\\n\\ttenets set forth in the Preamble of the Constitution.\"\\n\\nFreedom of culture and religion prevailed during the Ottoman Empire, allowing\\nthe many nations and races within its boundaries to remain autonomous. The\\nfact that the Ottoman Empire was the longest lived in recent history may be\\nattributed to these freedoms, despite the lack of any written Constitution.\\nThe first attempts to create a written Constitution occurred in 1839 and 1856.\\nAlthough the documents adopted during these two attempts remained in force\\nonly temporarily, they provided the basic elements of a Constitution.\\n\\nThe 1876 Constitution was the first legal document to force a Parliament and\\nthe right of election to share the sovereignty of the Emperor. The Constitution\\nof 1906 placed some additional limitations on the Emperor, while increasing\\nthe power of the Parliament and the government.\\n\\nThe First World War (1914-1918) brought the Ottoman Empire to an end. By the\\noccupation of Istanbul, the Parliament was dissolved and the Constitution was\\nabolished. The members of Parliament were sent to exile to an island by the\\noccupying forces.\\n\\nDuring the Independence War, the \"Turkish Grand National Assembly\" held their\\nfirst meeting on April 23, 1920 to serve as the legislative body of the new\\nTurkish state. This assembly prepared the new legal structure of the Turkish\\nRepublic. The new Republic was proclaimed on October 29, 1923 and the new\\nConstitution was adopted in 1924. That Constitution served as the legal \\nbackbone of today\\'s modern Turkish Republic. In 1945, Turkey adopted a \\nmulti-party political system. The Constitution of 1924 was replaced by\\nothers in 1961 and 1982. All three Constitutions of the Republic have been\\nbased on the principles of parliamentary democracy, human rights, national\\nsovereignty, division of powers, private ownership and secularization.\\n\\n\"Major Principles of the Constitution\"\\n\\nThe constitution (with 177 Articles) establishes the structure of the Republic\\nwithin the following principles:\\n\\n- The Turkish Republic is a democratic, secular and social state governed by \\n  law;\\n- It should be governed to maintain public peace, national solidarity, justice,\\n  human rights and the objectives of Ataturk;\\n- The language of the State is Turkish;\\n- Sovereignty is vested in the nation without any conditions or restrictions.\\n  Sovereignty is exercised by organizations authorized by the nation;\\n- Legislative power is carried by the Parliament elected by the nation. This\\n  power cannot be delegated (transferred) to any one else;\\n- Executive power is exercised by the President, and Council of Ministers;\\n- Judicial power is exercised by the independent courts on behalf of the\\n  Turkish nation;\\n- All individuals are equal, irrespective of language, race, religion, color,\\n  sex, or political beliefs;\\n- Laws cannot be contradict those principles stated in the Constitution.\\n\\n\"Structure of the State\"\\n\\nIn accordance with the Constitution, the structure of the state is based on the\\nprinciple of \"division of power\" to create a balanced and self-controlled\\nsystem. The power is divided into \"legislative power,\" \"executive power,\" and\\n\"judicial power,\" balanced to secure freedoms and powers to control each\\nother (self-control).\\n\\n A. Legislative Power:\\n\\n The \"Turkish Grand National Assembly\" is a parliament with one House, elected\\n by the nation for a term of five years to exercise legislative power on\\n behalf of the nation. The basic functions of this Assembly are:\\n\\n - to adopt, to amend, or to repeal laws;\\n - to approve or to dismiss the Council of Ministers;\\n - to supervise and to question Ministers or the Council of Ministers;\\n - to debate, to amend and to approve annual budgets;\\n - to ratify international agreements;\\n - to grant amnesty or pardons.\\n\\n Members of Parliament do not have any liability for their words (either oral\\n or written) during the course of their legislative duties. The country is\\n divided into constituencies. The number of representatives of each is\\n calculated according to its population. Every Turkish citizen over the age\\n of twenty-one can vote.\\n\\n Elections are supervised by the \"Supreme Council of Elections,\" which solves\\n all disputes or appeals. In each province, the local \"Board of Election\"\\n runs and controls the election under the supervision and guidelines of the\\n Supreme Council. Members of the Council and Boards are elected among \\n independent judges.\\n\\n B. Executive Power:\\n\\n The President of the Republic is the Head of State (not the head of government\\n as in the Unites States). The main functions of the President are:\\n\\n - to represent the State and the Country;\\n - to insure the implementation of the Constitution;\\n - to coordinate legislative, judicial and executive functions;\\n - act as the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces;\\n - to ratify laws and government decrees.\\n \\n The President is elected by the Grand National Assembly for a period of seven\\n years. The President may ratify or return the laws for a second debate, may \\n call for a referendum.\\n\\n Executive power is exercised by the \"Council of Ministers,\" headed by the\\n Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is appointed by the President from the\\n members of Parliament. The Prime Minister names the Ministers for approval\\n by the President. The new Government (Council of Ministers) reads their\\n program at the Parliament and the vote of confidence follows. There are 21 (?)\\n Ministers in the Council.\\n\\n Ministers and other members of the administration can be sued in independent\\n \"administrative\" courts for their misuse of power, administrative errors or\\n functions against any law.\\n\\n C. Judicial Power:\\n\\n Judicial power is exercised by independent courts. No authority or power can\\n instruct the judges or public prosecutors of the courts. These cannot be \\n discharged, replaced or retired by executive authorities except for the\\n reasons clearly stated by the appropriate laws. There are three categories\\n of courts in the Turkish judiciary system:\\n\\n - Courts of justice deal with legal, commercial and criminal cases. The \\n   decisions of these courts may be reviewed by the supreme court of justice\\n   upon the appeal of the parties involved.\\n - The decisions or functions of the executive power (including the Prime\\n   Minister and Ministers or any governmental department) can be appealed in\\n   administrative courts if these functions or decisions are against the law.\\n   The decisions of these administrative courts may also be reviewed by the\\n   high administrative court.\\n\\n The laws and decisions of the Grand National Assembly can be examined by the\\n \"Constitutional Court\" if they contradict the Constitution. If found\\n contradictory, this court may cancel the decisions or laws of the Parliament.\\n\\n\\nSerdar Argic\\n\\n                           \\'We closed the roads and mountain passes that \\n                            might serve as ways of escape for the Turks \\n                            and then proceeded in the work of extermination.\\'\\n                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)\\n                           \\'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists \\n                            a single Turkish soul.\\' (Sahak Melkonian - 1920)\\n\\n\\n'),\n",

Matthew\\n    Wiener (weemba@libra.wistar.upenn.edu) contributed the section on\\n    Voyager, and the section on Sakigake was obtained from ISAS material\\n    posted by Yoshiro Yamada (yamada@yscvax.ysc.go.jp).\\n\\nUS PLANETARY MISSIONS\\n\\n\\n    MARINER (VENUS, MARS, & MERCURY FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)\\n\\n    MARINER 1, the first U.S. attempt to send a spacecraft to Venus, failed\\n    minutes after launch in 1962. The guidance instructions from the ground\\n    stopped reaching the rocket due to a problem with its antenna, so the\\n    onboard computer took control. However, there turned out to be a bug in\\n    the guidance software, and the rocket promptly went off course, so the\\n    Range Safety Officer destroyed it. Although the bug is sometimes claimed\\n    to have been an incorrect FORTRAN DO statement, it was actually a\\n    transcription error in which the bar (indicating smoothing) was omitted\\n    from the expression \"R-dot-bar sub n\" (nth smoothed value of derivative\\n    of radius). This error led the software to treat normal minor variations\\n    of velocity as if they were serious, leading to incorrect compensation.\\n\\n    MARINER 2 became the first successful probe to flyby Venus in December\\n    of 1962, and it returned information which confirmed that Venus is a\\n    very hot (800 degrees Fahrenheit, now revised to 900 degrees F.) world\\n    with a cloud-covered atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide\\n    (sulfuric acid was later confirmed in 1978).\\n\\n    MARINER 3, launched on November 5, 1964, was lost when its protective\\n    shroud failed to eject as the craft was placed into interplanetary\\n    space. Unable to collect the Sun\\'s energy for power from its solar\\n    panels, the probe soon died when its batteries ran out and is now in\\n    solar orbit. It was intended for a Mars flyby with MARINER 4.\\n\\n    MARINER 4, the sister probe to MARINER 3, did reach Mars in 1965 and\\n    took the first close-up images of the Martian surface (22 in all) as it\\n    flew by the planet. The probe found a cratered world with an atmosphere\\n    much thinner than previously thought. Many scientists concluded from\\n    this preliminary scan that Mars was a \"dead\" world in both the\\n    geological and biological sense.\\n\\n    MARINER 5 was sent to Venus in 1967. It reconfirmed the data on that\\n    planet collected five years earlier by MARINER 2, plus the information\\n    that Venus\\' atmospheric pressure at its surface is at least 90 times\\n    that of Earth\\'s, or the equivalent of being 3,300 feet under the surface\\n    of an ocean.\\n\\n    MARINER 6 and 7 were sent to Mars in 1969 and expanded upon the work\\n    done by MARINER 4 four years earlier. However, they failed to take away\\n    the concept of Mars as a \"dead\" planet, first made from the basic\\n    measurements of MARINER 4.\\n\\n    MARINER 8 ended up in the Atlantic Ocean in 1971 when the rocket\\n    launcher autopilot failed.\\n\\n    MARINER 9, the sister probe to MARINER 8, became the first craft to\\n    orbit Mars in 1971. It returned information on the Red Planet that no\\n    other probe had done before, revealing huge volcanoes on the Martian\\n    surface, as well as giant canyon systems, and evidence that water once\\n    flowed across the planet. The probe also took the first detailed closeup\\n    images of Mars\\' two small moons, Phobos and Deimos.\\n\\n    MARINER 10 used Venus as a gravity assist to Mercury in 1974. The probe\\n    did return the first close-up images of the Venusian atmosphere in\\n    ultraviolet, revealing previously unseen details in the cloud cover,\\n    plus the fact that the entire cloud system circles the planet in four\\n    Earth days. MARINER 10 eventually made three flybys of Mercury from 1974\\n    to 1975 before running out of attitude control gas. The probe revealed\\n    Mercury as a heavily cratered world with a mass much greater than\\n    thought. This would seem to indicate that Mercury has an iron core which\\n    makes up 75 percent of the entire planet.\\n\\n\\n    PIONEER (MOON, SUN, VENUS, JUPITER, and SATURN FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)\\n\\n    PIONEER 1 through 3 failed to meet their main objective - to photograph\\n    the Moon close-up - but they did reach far enough into space to provide\\n    new information on the area between Earth and the Moon, including new\\n    data on the Van Allen radiation belts circling Earth. All three craft\\n    had failures with their rocket launchers. PIONEER 1 was launched on\\n    October 11, 1958, PIONEER 2 on November 8, and PIONEER 3 on December 6.\\n\\n    PIONEER 4 was a Moon probe which missed the Moon and became the first\\n    U.S. spacecraft to orbit the Sun in 1959. PIONEER 5 was originally\\n    designed to flyby Venus, but the mission was scaled down and it instead\\n    studied the interplanetary environment between Venus and Earth out to\\n    36.2 million kilometers in 1960, a record until MARINER 2. PIONEER 6\\n    through 9 were placed into solar orbit from 1965 to 1968: PIONEER 6, 7,\\n    and 8 are still transmitting information at this time. PIONEER E (would\\n    have been number 10) suffered a launch failure in 1969.\\n\\n    PIONEER 10 became the first spacecraft to flyby Jupiter in 1973. PIONEER\\n    11 followed it in 1974, and then went on to become the first probe to\\n    study Saturn in 1979. Both vehicles should continue to function through\\n    1995 and are heading off into interstellar space, the first craft ever\\n    to do so.\\n\\n    PIONEER Venus 1 (1978) (also known as PIONEER Venus Orbiter, or PIONEER\\n    12) burned up in the Venusian atmosphere on October 8, 1992. PVO made\\n    the first radar studies of the planet\\'s surface via probe. PIONEER Venus\\n    2 (also known as PIONEER 13) sent four small probes into the atmosphere\\n    in December of 1978. The main spacecraft bus burned up high in the\\n    atmosphere, while the four probes descended by parachute towards the\\n    surface. Though none were expected to survive to the surface, the Day\\n    probe did make it and transmitted for 67.5 minutes on the ground before\\n    its batteries failed.\\n\\n\\n    RANGER (LUNAR LANDER AND IMPACT MISSIONS)\\n\\n    RANGER 1 and 2 were test probes for the RANGER lunar impact series. They\\n    were meant for high Earth orbit testing in 1961, but rocket problems\\n    left them in useless low orbits which quickly decayed.\\n\\n    RANGER 3, launched on January 26, 1962, was intended to land an\\n    instrument capsule on the surface of the Moon, but problems during the\\n    launch caused the probe to miss the Moon and head into solar orbit.\\n    RANGER 3 did try to take some images of the Moon as it flew by, but the\\n    camera was unfortunately aimed at deep space during the attempt.\\n\\n    RANGER 4, launched April 23, 1962, had the same purpose as RANGER 3, but\\n    suffered technical problems enroute and crashed on the lunar farside,\\n    the first U.S. probe to reach the Moon, albeit without returning data.\\n\\n    RANGER 5, launched October 18, 1962 and similar to RANGER 3 and 4, lost\\n    all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually missed the Moon\\n    and drifted off into solar orbit.\\n\\n    RANGER 6 through 9 had more modified lunar missions: They were to send\\n    back live images of the lunar surface as they headed towards an impact\\n    with the Moon. RANGER 6 failed this objective in 1964 when its cameras\\n    did not operate. RANGER 7 through 9 performed well, becoming the first\\n    U.S. lunar probes to return thousands of lunar images through 1965.\\n\\n\\n    LUNAR ORBITER (LUNAR SURFACE PHOTOGRAPHY)\\n\\n    LUNAR ORBITER 1 through 5 were designed to orbit the Moon and image\\n    various sites being studied as landing areas for the manned APOLLO\\n    missions of 1969-1972. The probes also contributed greatly to our\\n    understanding of lunar surface features, particularly the lunar farside.\\n    All five probes of the series, launched from 1966 to 1967, were\\n    essentially successful in their missions. They were the first U.S.\\n    probes to orbit the Moon. All LOs were eventually crashed into the lunar\\n    surface to avoid interference with the manned APOLLO missions.\\n\\n\\n    SURVEYOR (LUNAR SOFT LANDERS)\\n\\n    The SURVEYOR series were designed primarily to see if an APOLLO lunar\\n    module could land on the surface of the Moon without sinking into the\\n    soil (before this time, it was feared by some that the Moon was covered\\n    in great layers of dust, which would not support a heavy landing\\n    vehicle). SURVEYOR was successful in proving that the lunar surface was\\n    strong enough to hold up a spacecraft from 1966 to 1968.\\n\\n    Only SURVEYOR 2 and 4 were unsuccessful missions. The rest became the\\n    first U.S. probes to soft land on the Moon, taking thousands of images\\n    and scooping the soil for analysis. APOLLO 12 landed 600 feet from\\n    SURVEYOR 3 in 1969 and returned parts of the craft to Earth. SURVEYOR 7,\\n    the last of the series, was a purely scientific mission which explored\\n    the Tycho crater region in 1968.\\n\\n\\n    VIKING (MARS ORBITERS AND LANDERS)\\n\\n    VIKING 1 was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida on August 20, 1975 on\\n    a TITAN 3E-CENTAUR D1 rocket. The probe went into Martian orbit on June\\n    19, 1976, and the lander set down on the western slopes of Chryse\\n    Planitia on July 20, 1976. It soon began its programmed search for\\n    Martian micro-organisms (there is still debate as to whether the probes\\n    found life there or not), and sent back incredible color panoramas of\\n    its surroundings. One thing scientists learned was that Mars\\' sky was\\n    pinkish in color, not dark blue as they originally thought (the sky is\\n    pink due to sunlight reflecting off the reddish dust particles in the\\n    thin atmosphere). The lander set down among a field of red sand and\\n    boulders stretching out as far as its cameras could image.\\n\\n    The VIKING 1 orbiter kept functioning until August 7, 1980, when it ran\\n    out of attitude-control propellant. The lander was switched into a\\n    weather-reporting mode, where it had been hoped it would keep\\n    functioning through 1994; but after November 13, 1982, an errant command\\n    had been sent to the lander accidentally telling it to shut down until\\n    further orders. Communication was never regained again, despite the\\n    engineers\\' efforts through May of 1983.\\n\\n    An interesting side note: VIKING 1\\'s lander has been designated the\\n    Thomas A. Mutch Memorial Station in honor of the late leader of the\\n    lander imaging team. The National Air and Space Museum in Washington,\\n    D.C. is entrusted with the safekeeping of the Mutch Station Plaque until\\n    it can be attached to the lander by a manned expedition.\\n\\n    VIKING 2 was launched on September 9, 1975, and arrived in Martian orbit\\n    on August 7, 1976. The lander touched down on September 3, 1976 in\\n    Utopia Planitia. It accomplished essentially the same tasks as its\\n    sister lander, with the exception that its seisometer worked, recording\\n    one marsquake. The orbiter had a series of attitude-control gas leaks in\\n    1978, which prompted it being shut down that July. The lander was shut\\n    down on April 12, 1980.\\n\\n    The orbits of both VIKING orbiters should decay around 2025.\\n\\n\\n    VOYAGER (OUTER PLANET FLYBYS)\\n\\n    VOYAGER 1 was launched September 5, 1977, and flew past Jupiter on March\\n    5, 1979 and by Saturn on November 13, 1980. VOYAGER 2 was launched\\n    August 20, 1977 (before VOYAGER 1), and flew by Jupiter on August 7,\\n    1979, by Saturn on August 26, 1981, by Uranus on January 24, 1986, and\\n    by Neptune on August 8, 1989. VOYAGER 2 took advantage of a rare\\n    once-every-189-years alignment to slingshot its way from outer planet to\\n    outer planet. VOYAGER 1 could, in principle, have headed towards Pluto,\\n    but JPL opted for the sure thing of a Titan close up.\\n\\n    Between the two probes, our knowledge of the 4 giant planets, their\\n    satellites, and their rings has become immense. VOYAGER 1&2 discovered\\n    that Jupiter has complicated atmospheric dynamics, lightning and\\n    aurorae. Three new satellites were discovered. Two of the major\\n    surprises were that Jupiter has rings and that Io has active sulfurous\\n    volcanoes, with major effects on the Jovian magnetosphere.\\n\\n    When the two probes reached Saturn, they discovered over 1000 ringlets\\n    and 7 satellites, including the predicted shepherd satellites that keep\\n    the rings stable. The weather was tame compared with Jupiter: massive\\n    jet streams with minimal variance (a 33-year great white spot/band cycle\\n    is known). Titan\\'s atmosphere was smoggy. Mimas\\' appearance was\\n    startling: one massive impact crater gave it the Death Star appearance.\\n    The big surprise here was the stranger aspects of the rings. Braids,\\n    kinks, and spokes were both unexpected and difficult to explain.\\n\\n    VOYAGER 2, thanks to heroic engineering and programming efforts,\\n    continued the mission to Uranus and Neptune. Uranus itself was highly\\n    monochromatic in appearance. One oddity was that its magnetic axis was\\n    found to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational\\n    axis, giving Uranus a peculiar magnetosphere. Icy channels were found on\\n    Ariel, and Miranda was a bizarre patchwork of different terrains. 10\\n    satellites and one more ring were discovered.\\n\\n    In contrast to Uranus, Neptune was found to have rather active weather,\\n    including numerous cloud features. The ring arcs turned out to be bright\\n    patches on one ring. Two other rings, and 6 other satellites, were\\n    discovered. Neptune\\'s magnetic axis was also skewed. Triton had a\\n    canteloupe appearance and geysers. (What\\'s liquid at 38K?)\\n\\n    The two VOYAGERs are expected to last for about two more decades. Their\\n    on-target journeying gives negative evidence about possible planets\\n    beyond Pluto. Their next major scientific discovery should be the\\n    location of the heliopause.\\n\\n\\nSOVIET PLANETARY MISSIONS\\n\\n    Since there have been so many Soviet probes to the Moon, Venus, and\\n    Mars, I will highlight only the primary missions:\\n\\n\\n    SOVIET LUNAR PROBES\\n\\n    LUNA 1 - Lunar impact attempt in 1959, missed Moon and became first\\n\\t     craft in solar orbit.\\n    LUNA 2 - First craft to impact on lunar surface in 1959.\\n    LUNA 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1959.\\n    ZOND 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1965 since LUNA 3. Was\\n\\t     also a test for future Mars missions.\\n    LUNA 9 - First probe to soft land on the Moon in 1966, returned images\\n\\t     from surface.\\n    LUNA 10 - First probe to orbit the Moon in 1966.\\n    LUNA 13 - Second successful Soviet lunar soft landing mission in 1966.\\n    ZOND 5 - First successful circumlunar craft.

LUNA 20 accomplished similar mission in\\n\\t      1972.\\n    LUNA 17 - Delivered the first unmanned lunar rover to the Moon\\'s\\n\\t      surface, LUNOKHOD 1, in 1970. A similar feat was accomplished\\n\\t      with LUNA 21/LUNOKHOD 2 in 1973.\\n    LUNA 24 - Last Soviet lunar mission to date. Returned soil samples in\\n\\t      1976.\\n\\n\\n    SOVIET VENUS PROBES\\n\\n    VENERA 1 - First acknowledged attempt at Venus mission. Transmissions\\n\\t       lost enroute in 1961.\\n    VENERA 2 - Attempt to image Venus during flyby mission in tandem with\\n\\t       VENERA 3. Probe ceased transmitting just before encounter in\\n\\t       February of 1966. No images were returned.\\n    VENERA 3 - Attempt to place a lander capsule on Venusian surface.\\n\\t       Transmissions ceased just before encounter and entire probe\\n\\t       became the first craft to impact on another planet in 1966.\\n    VENERA 4 - First probe to successfully return data while descending\\n\\t       through Venusian atmosphere. Crushed by air pressure before\\n\\t       reaching surface in 1967. VENERA 5 and 6 mission profiles\\n\\t       similar in 1969.\\n    VENERA 7 - First probe to return data from the surface of another planet\\n\\t       in 1970. VENERA 8 accomplished a more detailed mission in\\n\\t       1972.\\n    VENERA 9 - Sent first image of Venusian surface in 1975. Was also the\\n\\t       first probe to orbit Venus.

Flyby buses went on\\n\\t     to become first spacecraft to study Comet Halley close-up in\\n\\t     March of 1986.\\n\\n\\n    SOVIET MARS PROBES\\n\\n    MARS 1 - First acknowledged Mars probe in 1962. Transmissions ceased\\n\\t     enroute the following year.\\n    ZOND 2 - First possible attempt to place a lander capsule on Martian\\n\\t     surface. Probe signals ceased enroute in 1965.\\n    MARS 2 - First Soviet Mars probe to land - albeit crash - on Martian\\n\\t     surface. Orbiter section first Soviet probe to circle the Red\\n\\t     Planet in 1971.\\n    MARS 3 - First successful soft landing on Martian surface, but lander\\n\\t     signals ceased after 90 seconds in 1971.\\n    MARS 4 - Attempt at orbiting Mars in 1974, braking rockets failed to\\n\\t     fire, probe went on into solar orbit.\\n    MARS 5 - First fully successful Soviet Mars mission, orbiting Mars in\\n\\t     1974. Returned images of Martian surface comparable to U.S.\\n\\t     probe MARINER 9.\\n    MARS 6 - Landing attempt in 1974. Lander crashed into the surface.\\n    MARS 7 - Lander missed Mars completely in 1974, went into a solar orbit\\n\\t     with its flyby bus.\\n    PHOBOS 1 - First attempt to land probes on surface of Mars\\' largest\\n\\t       moon, Phobos. Probe failed enroute in 1988 due to\\n\\t       human/computer error.\\n    PHOBOS 2 - Attempt to land probes on Martian moon Phobos. The probe did\\n\\t       enter Mars orbit in early 1989, but signals ceased one week\\n\\t       before scheduled Phobos landing.\\n\\n    While there has been talk of Soviet Jupiter, Saturn, and even\\n    interstellar probes within the next thirty years, no major steps have\\n    yet been taken with these projects. More intensive studies of the Moon,\\n    Mars, Venus, and various comets have been planned for the 1990s, and a\\n    Mercury mission to orbit and land probes on the tiny world has been\\n    planned for 2003. How the many changes in the former Soviet Union (now\\n    the Commonwealth of Independent States) will affect the future of their\\n    space program remains to be seen.\\n\\n\\nJAPANESE PLANETARY MISSIONS\\n\\n    SAKIGAKE (MS-T5) was launched from the Kagoshima Space Center by ISAS on\\n    January 8 1985, and approached Halley\\'s Comet within about 7 million km\\n    on March 11, 1986. The spacecraft is carrying three instru- ments to\\n    measure interplanetary magnetic field/plasma waves/solar wind, all of\\n    which work normally now, so ISAS made an Earth swingby by Sakigake on\\n    January 8, 1992 into an orbit similar to the earth\\'s. The closest\\n    approach was at 23h08m47s (JST=UTC+9h) on January 8, 1992. The\\n    geocentric distance was 88,997 km. This is the first planet-swingby for\\n    a Japanese spacecraft.\\n\\n    During the approach, Sakigake observed the geotail. Some geotail\\n    passages will be scheduled in some years hence. The second Earth-swingby\\n    will be on June 14, 1993 (at 40 Re (Earth\\'s radius)), and the third\\n    October 28, 1994 (at 86 Re).\\n\\n\\n    HITEN, a small lunar probe, was launched into Earth orbit on January 24,\\n    1990. The spacecraft was then known as MUSES-A, but was renamed to Hiten\\n    once in orbit. The 430 lb probe looped out from Earth and made its first\\n    lunary flyby on March 19, where it dropped off its 26 lb midget\\n    satellite, HAGOROMO. Japan at this point became the third nation to\\n    orbit a satellite around the Moon, joining the Unites States and USSR.\\n\\n    The smaller spacecraft, Hagoromo, remained in orbit around the Moon. An\\n    apparently broken transistor radio caused the Japanese space scientists\\n    to lose track of it. Hagoromo\\'s rocket motor fired on schedule on March\\n    19, but the spacecraft\\'s tracking transmitter failed immediately. The\\n    rocket firing of Hagoromo was optically confirmed using the Schmidt\\n    camera (105-cm, F3.1) at the Kiso Observatory in Japan.\\n\\n    Hiten made multiple lunar flybys at approximately monthly intervals and\\n    performed aerobraking experiments using the Earth\\'s atmosphere. Hiten\\n    made a close approach to the moon at 22:33 JST (UTC+9h) on February 15,\\n    1992 at the height of 423 km from the moon\\'s surface (35.3N, 9.7E) and\\n    fired its propulsion system for about ten minutes to put the craft into\\n    lunar orbit. The following is the orbital calculation results after the\\n    approach:\\n\\n\\tApoapsis Altitude: about 49,400 km\\n\\tPeriapsis Altitude: about 9,600 km\\n\\tInclination\\t: 34.7 deg (to ecliptic plane)\\n\\tPeriod\\t\\t: 4.7 days\\n\\n\\nPLANETARY MISSION REFERENCES\\n\\n    I also recommend reading the following works, categorized in three\\n    groups: General overviews, specific books on particular space missions,\\n    and periodical sources on space probes. This list is by no means\\n    complete; it is primarily designed to give you places to start your\\n    research through generally available works on the subject. If anyone can\\n    add pertinent works to the list, it would be greatly appreciated.\\n\\n    Though naturally I recommend all the books listed below, I think it\\n    would be best if you started out with the general overview books, in\\n    order to give you a clear idea of the history of space exploration in\\n    this area. I also recommend that you pick up some good, up-to-date\\n    general works on astronomy and the Sol system, to give you some extra\\n    background.

Your 2F2 cap\\nwill have been designed as a RAM battery substitute, rather than for use in\\napplications where you wish to drain the cap with a constant current. Their\\nperformance, in some respects, is more akin to batteries than to a normal cap.\\nThe other point is that big electro\\'s are usually rated with -5%+20% tolerances,\\nso calculating exactly what capacitance you have (particularly when considering\\nthe cold).\\n\\nYou should be looking at designing a micropower oscillator and divider chain,\\nthat \"rolls over\" (from zero to maximum count, or vice-versa) once every\\n1,209,600 seconds. If you were to use something like a 110Hz clock, you would\\nneed a divider chain of 2^27, to give an error of less than one percent in the\\nfiring times over the six week period. Of course, you could trim the 110Hz\\noscillator to give you exact time, but the likelyhood of the oscillator\\nremaining exactly constant at -40 is low anyway.\\n\\nI would suspect that there would be far more battrey drain in firing the\\nsolenoid than there would be in the timer circuit.\\n\\nCaveat - I\\'m not experienced in low temperature electronics, so I can\\'t\\nguarantee that this (or any other) approach is the best for inhospitable\\nconditions.\\n\\nJohnH\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n      |  _  |_   _   |_|  _   _|  _|              Electronics Department\\n    |_| (_) | | | |  | | (_| (_| (_| \\\\/           School of MPCE\\n    ---------------------------------/-           Macquarie University\\n                                                  Sydney, AUSTRALIA 2109\\n\\n    Email: johnh@mpce.mq.edu.au, Ph: +61 2 805 8959, Fax: +61 2 805 8983\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n'),\n",

I\\'m sorry if anyone thinks that I am wasting\\nspace, but I thought you might want some relief from the \"So-and-so is a thief\"\\nposts.  Not that I think we shouldn\\'t hear about the bad deals, but it would be\\nnice to hear some good news once in a while.\\n\\nAfter seeing his post on one of the for sale groups, I mailed Mr. Mark Miller a\\nrequest for his copy of WordPerfect 5.1 for DOS.  He suggested a price of $50\\nin his ad, but when I phoned him, he quoted $40 plus shipping.  That sounded\\nmore than fair to me, so I told him that I would send him a check the next day. \\nImagine my surprise when I logged into my account the following day and found a\\nmessage from him saying that it had already been sold (after I had just mailed\\nthe money order).  After another E-Mail message to him, he apologized and\\nassured me that it was a mistake - I was the one who he was holding it for.  He\\nsent the package as soon as he got the money, along with a letter stating a\\ntransfer of license.  This wasn\\'t good enough for WordPerfect, so I asked him\\nto fill out one of their forms.  No problem - we thought.  It took three times\\nto get it to the right address (my fault).  Anyway, he mailed me the form for\\nmy signature and included a Workbook that I had no idea was included in the\\ndeal.  Again, he apologized for not sending it before.  I now have the world\\'s\\nbest word processor and a renewed hope in the world that there are a few good\\nones left.  I recoend that if you ever see that Mark is selling anything thatat\\nyou may want, give him a call.  If I had the choice, I would purchase all of my\\nsoftware from him.\\n\\nBravo, Mr. Miller!\\n\\n- Kevin Harter\\n'),\n",

These include:\\n\\n1) Attempts to implicate Iran in the bombing of the New York Trade\\n   Center. Despite great efforts in this direction they have not\\n   succeeded in this. They, however, have indirectly created\\n   the impression that Iran is behind the rise of fundamentalist\\n   Islamic movements and thus are indirectly implicated in this matter.\\n\\n2) Public statements by the Secretary of State Christoffer and\\n   other official sources regarding Iran being a terrorist and\\n   outlaw state.\\n\\n3) And finally the recent broadcast of the Frontline program. I \\n   suspect that this PR campaign against Iran will continue and\\n   perhaps intensify.\\n\\nWhy this increased pressure on Iran? A number of factors may have\\nbeen behind this. These include:\\n\\n1) The rise of Islamic movements in North-Africa and radical\\n   Hamas movement in the Israeli occupied territories. This\\n   movement is basically anti-western and is not necessarily\\n   fueled by Iran. The cause for accelerated pace of this \\n   movement is probably the Gulf War which sought to return\\n   colonial Shieks and Amirs to their throne in the name of\\n   democracy and freedom. Also, the obvious support of Algerian\\n   military coup against the democratically elected Algerian\\n   Islamic Front which clearly exposed the democracy myth.\\n   A further cause of this may be the daily broadcast of the news\\n   on the slaughter of Bosnian Moslems.\\n\\n2) Possible future implications of this movement in Saudi Arabia\\n   and other US client states and endangerment of the cheap oil\\n   sources from this region.\\n\\n3) A need to create an enemy as an excuse for huge defense\\n   expenditures. This has become necessary after the demise of\\n   Soveit Union.\\n\\nThe recent PR campaign against Iran, however, seems to be directed\\nfrom Israel rather than Washington. There is no fundamental conflict\\nof interest between Iran and the US and in my opinion, it is in the\\ninterest of both countries to affect reestablishment of normal\\nand friendly relations. This may have a moderating effect on the\\nrise of radical movements within the Islamic world and Iran .\\n\\n--jamshid\\n'),\n",

Since it hasn\\'t\\nbeen posted for some time (and I\\'ve modified it somewhat since the\\nlast time), I\\'m taking this opportunity to post it.  There is another\\nentry in the FAQ containing comments by some other contributors.  They\\ncan be retrieved from ftp.rutgers.edu as\\npub/soc.religion.christian/others/homosexuality.  It contains far\\nmore detail on the exegetical issues than I give here, though\\nprimarily from a conservative point of view.\\n\\n----------------------------\\n\\nThis posting summarizes several issues involving homosexuality and\\nChristians.  This is a frequently asked question, so I do not post the\\nquestion each time it occurs.  Rather this is an attempt to summarize\\nthe postings we get when we have a discussion.  It summarizes\\narguments for allowing Christian homosexuality, since most people\\nasking the question already know the arguments against it.  The most\\ncommon -- but not the only -- question dealt with herein is \"how can a\\nChristian justify being a homosexual, given what the Bible says about\\nit?\"\\n\\nFirst, on the definition of \\'homosexual\\'.  Many groups believe that\\nthere is a homosexual \"orientation\", i.e. a sexual attraction to\\nmembers of the same sex.  This is distinguished from actual homosexual\\nsexual activity.  Homosexuals who abstain from sex are considered by\\nmost groups to be acceptable.  However in a lot of discussion, the\\nterm \\'homosexual\\' means someone actually engaging in homosexual sex.\\nThis is generally not accepted outside the most \\'liberal\\' groups.  In\\nthis paper I\\'m going to use \\'homosexual\\' as meaning a person engaging\\nin sexual acts with another of the same sex.  I haven\\'t heard of any\\nBiblical argument against a person with homosexual orientation who\\nremains celebate.\\n\\nI think most people now admit that there is a predisposition to be\\nhomosexual.  This is often called a \\'homosexual orientation\\'.  It is\\nnot known whether it is genetic or environmental.  There is evidence\\nsuggesting each.  The best evidence I\\'ve seen is that homosexuality is\\nnot a single phenomenon, but has a number of different causes.  One of\\nthem is probably genetic.  There are several groups that try to help\\npeople move from being homosexual to heterosexual.  The best-known is\\nExodus International\".  The reports I\\'ve seen (and I haven\\'t read the\\ndetailed literature, just the summary in the minority opinion to the\\nPresbyterian Church\\'s infamous report on human sexuality) suggest that\\nthese programs have very low success rates, and that there are\\nquestions about how real even the successes are.  But there certainly\\nare people who say they have converted.  However this issue is not as\\nimportant as it sounds.  Those who believe homosexuality is wrong\\nbelieve it is intrinsically wrong, defined as such by God.  The fact\\nthat it\\'s hard to get out of being a homosexual is no more relevant\\nthan the fact that it\\'s hard to escape from being a drug addict.  If\\nit\\'s wrong, it\\'s wrong.  It may affect how we deal with people though.\\nIf it\\'s very difficult to change, this may tend to make us more\\nwilling to forgive it.\\n\\nOne more general background issue: It\\'s common to quote a figure that\\n10% of the population is homosexual.  I asked one of our experts where\\nthis came from.  Here\\'s his response: Kinsey (see below) is the source\\nof the figure 10 percent.  He defines sexuality by behavior, not by\\norientation, and ranked all persons on a scale from Zero (completely\\nheterosexual) to 6 (completely heterosexual).  According to Kinsey,\\none-third of all male adults have had at least one experience of\\norgasm homosexually post puberty.  Ten percent of all adult males have\\nmost of their experiences of homosexually.  That was in 1948.  The\\npercentages held true in a followup study done by the Kinsey\\nInstitute, based on data in the early seventies but not published\\nuntil the early 80s or so, by Bell and Weinberg, I believe.  I can\\'t\\nput my hand on this latter reference, but here is the online\\ninformation for Kinsey\\'s own study as it appears in IRIS, the catalog\\nat Rutgers:\\n   AUTHOR Kinsey, Alfred Charles, 1894-1956.\\n    TITLE Sexual behavior in the human male [by] Alfred C.

A\\njournalist is running the rounds of talk shows this season promoting\\nher book that allegedly refutes Kinsey\\'s study, but the scholarly\\nworld seems to take her for a kook......\\n\\nI\\'ve seen some objections to the Kinsey\\'s study, but not in enough\\ndetail to include here.  (If someone would like to contribute another\\nview, I\\'d be willing to include it.)\\n\\nMost Christians believe homosexuality (at least genital sex) is wrong.\\nNot all, however.  A few denominations accept it.  The Metropolitan\\nCommunity Churches is the best-known -- it was formed specifically to\\naccept homosexuals.  However the United Church of Christ also allows\\nit, and I think a couple of other groups may as well.  The Episcopal\\nChurch seems to accept it some areas but not others.  In churches that\\nhave congregational government, you\\'ll find a few congregations that\\naccept it (even among Southern Baptists, though the number is probably\\nonly one or two congregations).  But these are unusual -- few churches\\npermit homosexual church leaders.  How carefully they enforce this is\\nanother issue.  I don\\'t have any doubt that there are homosexual\\npastors of just about every denomination, some more open than others.\\n\\nAs to the arguments over the Biblical and other issues, here\\'s an\\nattempt to summarize the issues:\\n\\nThe most commonly cited reference by those favoring acceptance of\\nhomosexuality in previous discussions has been John Boswell:\\n\"Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality\", U Chicago Press,\\n1980.\\n\\nThe argument against is pretty clear.  There are several explicit laws\\nin the OT, e.g. Leviticus 20:13, and in Rom 1 Paul seems pretty negative on\\nhomosexuality.  Beyond these references, there are some debates.  Some\\npassages often cited on the subject probably are not relevant.  E.g.\\nthe sin which the inhabitants of Sodom proposed to carry out was\\nhomosexual *rape*, not homosexual activity between consenting adults.\\n(There\\'s even some question whether it was homosexual, since the\\nentities involved were angels.)  It was particularly horrifying\\nbecause it involved guests, and the responsibility towards guests in\\nthat culture was very strong.  (This is probably the reason Lot\\noffered his daughter -- it was better to give up his daughter than to\\nallow his guests to be attacked.)  If you look through a concordance\\nfor references to Sodom elsewhere in the Bible, you\\'ll see that few\\nseem to imply that homosexuality was their sin.  There\\'s a Jewish\\ninterpretive tradition that the major sin was abuse of guests.  At any\\nrate, there\\'s no debate that homosexual *rape* is wrong.\\n\\nI do not discuss Leviticus because the law there is part of a set\\nof laws that most Christians do not consider binding.  So unless NT\\njustification can be found, Lev. alone would not settle the issue.\\n\\nThe NT references are all in Paul\\'s letters.  A number of the\\nreferences from Paul are lists of sins in which the words are fairly\\nvague.  Boswell argues that the words occuring in these lists do not\\nmean homosexual.  Here\\'s what he says: The two Greek words that appear\\nin the lists (i.e. I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10) are /malakos/ and\\n/arsenokoitai/.  Unfortunately it is not entirely clear what the words\\nactually mean.  /malakos/, with a basic meaning of soft, has a variety\\nof metaphorical meanings in ethical writing.  Boswell suggests\\n\"wanton\" as a likely equivalent.  He also reports that the unanimous\\ninterpretation of the Church, including Greek-speaking Christians, was\\nthat in this passage it referred to masturbation, a meaning that has\\nvanished only in the 20th Cent., as that practice has come to be less\\nfrowned-upon.  (He cites references as late as the 1967 edition of the\\nCatholic Encyclopedia that identify it as masturbation.)  He\\ntranslates /arsenokotai/ as male prostitute, giving evidence that none\\nof the church fathers understood the term as referring to\\nhomosexuality in general.  A more technical meaning, suggested by the\\nearly Latin translations, would be \"active mode homosexual male\\nprostitute\", but in his view Paul did not intend it so technically.\\n\\nFor a more conservative view, I consulted Gordon Fee\\'s commentary on I\\nCor.  He cites evidence that /malakos/ often meant effeminate.\\nHowever Boswell warns us that in Greek culture effeminate is not\\nnecessarily synonymous with homosexual, though it may be associated\\nwith some kinds of homosexual behavior.  Given what Boswell and Fee\\nsay taken together, I suspect that the term is simply not very\\ndefinite, and that while it applies to homosexuals in some cases, it\\nisn\\'t a general term for homosexuality.  While Fee argues against\\nBoswell with /arsenokotai/ as well, he ends up suggesting a\\ntranslation that seems essentially the same.  The big problem with it\\nis that the word is almost never used.  Paul\\'s writing is the first\\noccurence.  The fact that the word is clearly composed of \"male\" and\\n\"f**k\" unfortunately doesn\\'t quite tell us the meaning, since it\\ndoesn\\'t tell us whether the male is the subject or object of the\\naction.  Examples of compound words formed either way can be given.\\nIn theory it could refer to rapists, etc.  It\\'s dangerous to base\\nmeaning purely on etymology, or you\\'ll conclude that \"goodbye\" is a\\nreligious expression because it\\'s based on \"God by with ye\".  However\\nsince Boswell, Fee, and NIV seem to agree on \"homosexual male\\nprostitute\", that seems as good a guess as any.  Note that this\\ntranslation misses the strong vulgarity of the term however (something\\nwhich Fee and Boswell agree on, but do not attempt to reproduce in\\ntheir translation).\\n\\nIn my opinion, the strongest NT reference to homosexuality is Romans\\n1.  Boswell points out that Rom 1 speaks of homosexuality as something\\nthat happened to people who were naturally heterosexual, as a result\\nof their corruption due to worshipping false gods.  One could argue\\nthat this is simply an example: that if a homosexual worshipped false\\ngods, he would also fall into degradation and perhaps become\\nheterosexual.  However I find this argument somewhat forced, and in\\nfact our homosexual readers have not seriously proposed that this is\\nwhat Paul meant.\\n\\nHowever I am not convinced that Rom 1 is sufficient to create a law\\nagainst homosexuality for Christians.  What Paul is describing in Rom\\n1 is not homosexuality among Christians -- it\\'s homosexuality that\\nappeared among idolaters as one part of a whole package of wickedness.\\nDespite the impression left by his impassioned rhetoric, I\\'m sure Paul\\ndoes not believe that pagans completely abandoned heterosexual sex.\\nGiven his description of their situation, I rather assume that their\\nheterosexual sex would also be debased and shameless.  So yes, I do\\nbelieve that this passage indicates a negative view of homosexuality.\\nBut in all fairness, the \"shameless\" nature of their acts is a\\nreflection of the general spiritual state of the people, and not a\\nspecific feature of homosexuality.\\n\\nMy overall view of the situation is the following: I think we have\\nenough evidence to be confident that Paul disapproved of\\nhomosexuality.  Rom 1 seems clear.  While I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10 are\\nnot unambiguous and general condemnations of homosexuality, they do\\nnot seem like wording that would come from someone who approved of\\nhomosexuality or even considered it acceptable in some cases.  On the\\nother hand, none of these passages contains explicit teachings on the\\nsubject.  Rom 1 is really about idolatry.  It refers to homosexuality\\nin passing.\\n\\nThe result of this situation is that people interpret these passages\\nin light of their general approach to Scripture.  For those who look\\nto Scripture for laws about issues such as this, it not surprising\\nthat they would consider these passages to be NT endorsement of the OT\\nprohibition.  For those whose approach to the Bible is more liberal,\\nit is not surprising that they regard Paul\\'s negative view of\\nhomosexuality as something that he took from his Jewish upbringing\\nwithout any serious reexamination in the light of the Gospel.  As\\nreaders of this group know by now, the assumptions behind these\\napproaches are so radically different that people tend to foam at the\\nmouth when they see the opposing view described.  There\\'s not a lot I\\ncan do as moderator about such a situation.\\n\\nA number of discussions in the past centered around the sort of\\ndetailed exegesis of texts that is described above.  However in fact\\nI\\'m not convinced that defenders of homosexuality actually base their\\nown beliefs on such analyses.  The real issue seems to rest on the\\nquestion of whether Paul\\'s judgement should apply to modern\\nhomosexuality.\\n\\nOne commonly made claim is that Paul had simply never faced the kinds\\nof questions we are trying to deal with.  He encountered homosexuality\\nonly in contexts where most people would probably agree that it was\\nwrong.  He had never faced the experience of Christians who try to act\\n\"straight\" and fail, and he had never faced Christians who are trying\\nto define a Christian homosexuality, which fits with general Christian\\nideals of fidelity and of seeing sexuality as a mirror of the\\nrelationship between God and man.  It is unfair to take Paul\\'s\\njudgement on homosexuality among idolaters and use it to make\\njudgements on these questions.\\n\\nAnother is the following: In Paul\\'s time homosexuality was associated\\nwith a number of things that Christians would not find acceptable.  It\\nwas part of temple prostitution.  Among private citizens, it often\\noccured between adults and children or free people and slaves.  I\\'m\\nnot in a position to say that it always did, but there are some\\nreasons to think so.  The ancients distinguished between the active\\nand passive partner.  It was considered disgraceful for a free adult\\nto act as the passive partner.  (This is the reason that an active\\nmode homosexual prostitute would be considered disgraceful.  His\\ncustomers would all be people who enjoyed the passive role.)  This\\nsupports the idea that it would tend not to be engaged in between two\\nfree adult males, at least not without some degree of scandal.\\nClearly Christian homosexuals would not condone sex with children,\\nslaves, or others who are not in a position to be fully responsible\\npartners.  (However Fee\\'s commentary on I Cor cites some examples from\\nancient literature of homosexual relationships that do seem to involve\\nfree adults in a reasonably symmetrical way.  Thus the considerations\\nin this paragraph shouldn\\'t be pushed too far.  Homosexuality may have\\nbeen discredited for Jews by some of these associations, but there\\nsurely must be been cases that were not prostitutes and did not\\ninvolve slaves or children.)\\n\\nSome people have argued that AIDS is a judgement against\\nhomosexuality.  I\\'d like to point out that AIDS is transmitted by\\npromiscuous sex, both homosexual and heterosexual.  Someone who has a\\nhomosexual relationship that meets Christian criteria for marriage is\\nnot at risk for AIDS.\\n\\nNote that there is good reason from Paul\\'s general approach to doubt\\nthat he would concede homosexuality as a fully equal alternative,\\napart from any specific statements on homosexuality.  I believe his\\nuse of the Genesis story would lead him to regard heterosexual\\nmarriage as what God ordained.\\n\\nHowever the way Paul deals with pastoral questions provides a warning\\nagainst being too quick to deal with this issue legally.\\n\\nI claim that the question of how to counsel homosexual Christians is\\nnot entirely a theological issue, but also a pastoral one.  Paul\\'s\\ntendency, as we can see in issues such as eating meat and celebrating\\nholidays, is to be uncompromising on principle but in pastoral issues\\nto look very carefully at the good of the people involved, and to\\navoid insisting on perfection when it would be personally damaging.\\nFor example, while Paul clearly believed that it was acceptable to eat\\nmeat, he wanted us to avoid pushing people into doing an action about\\nwhich they had personal qualms.  For another example, Paul obviously\\nwould have preferred to see people (at least in some circumstances)\\nremain unmarried.  Yet if they were unable to do so, he certainly\\nwould rather see them married than in a state where they might be\\ntempted to fornication.\\n\\nI believe one could take a view like this even while accepting the\\nviews Paul expressed in Rom 1.  One may believe that homosexuality is\\nnot what God intended, that it occured as a result of sin, but still\\nconclude that at times we have to live with it.  Note that in the\\ncreation story work enters human life as a result of sin.  This\\ndoesn\\'t mean that Christians can stop working when we are saved.  The\\nquestion is whether you believe that homosexuality is in itself sinful\\nor whether you believe that it\\'s a misfortune that is in a broad sense\\ndue to human sinfulness.  If you\\'re willing to consider the latter\\napproach, then it becomes a pastoral judgement whether there is more\\ndamage caused by finding a way to live with it or trying to cure it.\\nThe dangers of trying to cure it are that the attempt most often\\nfails, and when it does, you end up with damage ranging from\\npsychological damage to suicide, as well as broken marriages when\\nattempts at living as a heterosexual fail.\\n\\nThis is going to depend upon one\\'s assessment of the inherent nature\\nof homosexuality.  If you believe it is a very serious wrong, then you\\nmay be willing to run high risks of serious damage to get rid of it.\\nClearly we do not generally suggest that people live with a tendency\\nto steal or with drug addiction, even though attempts to cure these\\nconditions are also very difficult.  However these conditions are\\nintrinsically damaging in a way that is not so obvious for\\nhomosexuality.  (Many problems associated with homosexuality are\\nactually problems of promiscuity, not homosexuality.  This includes\\nAIDS.  I take for granted that the only sort of homosexual\\nrelationships a Christian would consider allowing would be equivalent\\nto Christian heterosexual relationships.)\\n\\nIn the course of discussing this over the last decade or so, we\\'ve\\nheard a lot of personal testimony from fellow Christians who are in\\nthis situation.  I\\'ve also seen summaries of various research and the\\nresults of various efforts for \"conversion\".  (Aside from the\\nPresbyterian report mentioned above, there\\'s an FAQ that summarizes\\nour readers\\' reports on this question.)  The evidence is that\\nlong-term success in changing orientation is rare enough to be on a\\npar with healing miracles.  The danger in advising Christians to\\ndepend upon such a change is clear: When \"conversion\" doesn\\'t happen,\\nwhich is almost always, the people are often left in despair, feeling\\nexcluded from a Church that has nothing more to say but a requirement\\nof life-long celibacy.  Paul recognized (though in a different\\ncontext) that such a demand is not practical for most people, and I\\nthink the history of clerical celibacy has strongly reinforced that\\njudgement.  The practical result is that homosexuals end up in the gay\\nsex clubs and the rest of the sordid side of homosexuality.  Maybe\\nhomosexuality isn\\'t God\\'s original ideal, but I can well imagine Paul\\npreferring to see people in long-term, committed Christian\\nrelationships than promiscuity.  As with work -- which Genesis\\nsuggests wasn\\'t part of God\\'s original ideal either -- I think such\\nrelationships can still be a vehicle for people sharing God\\'s love\\nwith each other.\\n\\nThere\\'s an issue of Biblical interpretation underlying this\\ndiscussion.  The issue is that of \"cultural relativism\".  That is,\\nwhen Paul says that something is wrong, should this be taken as an\\neternal statement, or are things wrong because of specific situations\\nin the culture of the time?  Conservative Christians generally insist\\non taking prohibitions as absolute, since otherwise the Bible becomes\\nsubjective -- what is to stop us from considering everything in it as\\nrelative?\\n\\nWhen looking at this issue, it\\'s worth noting that no one completely\\nrejects the concept of cultural relativism.  There are a number of\\njudgements in the New Testament that even conservative Christians\\nconsider to be relative.  The following judgements are at least as\\nclear in the Bible as anything said on homosexuality:\\n\\n  - prohibition against charging interest (this occurs 18 times in\\n\\tthe OT -- it\\'s not in the NT, but I mention it here because\\n\\tuntil relatively recently the Church did consider it binding\\n\\ton Christians)\\n  - prohibition against swearing oaths\\n  - endorsement of slavery as an institution\\n  - judgement of tax collectors as sinner\\n\\nWe do not regard these items as binding.  In most cases, I believe the\\nargument is essentially one of cultural relativism.  Briefly:\\n\\n  - prohibition of interest is appropriate to a specific\\n\\tagrarian society that the Bible was trying to build,\\n\\tbut not to our market economy.\\n  - few people believe that American judicial oaths have the\\n\\tsame characteristics as the kind of oaths Jesus was\\n\\tconcerned about\\n  - most people believe that Paul was simply telling people\\n\\thow to live within slavery, but not endorsing it as\\n\\tan institution\\n  - for people believe that the IRS is morally equivalent to\\n\\tRoman tax farming\\n\\nThe point I\\'m trying to make is that before applying Biblical\\nprohibitions to the 20th Cent., we need to look at whether the 20th\\nCent. actions are the same.  When Christian homosexuals say that their\\nrelationships are different than the Greek homosexuality that Paul\\nwould have been familiar with, this is exactly the same kind of\\nargument that is being made about judicial oaths and tax collectors.\\nUntil fairly recently Christians prohibited taking of interest, and\\nmany Christians regarded slavery as divinely endorsed.  (Indeed,\\nslavery is one of the more common metaphors for the relationship\\nbetween God and human beings -- Christians are often called servants\\nor slaves of God.)\\n\\nI am not trying to say that everything in the Bible is culturally\\nrelative.  Rather, I\\'m trying to say that *some* things are, and\\ntherefore it is not enough to say that because something appears in\\nthe Bible, that ends the discussion.  We need to look at whether the\\naction we\\'re talking about now has the same moral implications as the\\none that the Bible was talking about.  If Christians want to argue\\nthat there are reasons to think that the prohibitions against\\nhomosexuality are still binding, I\\'m willing to listen.  Those who\\nclaim that the question doesn\\'t need to be looked at are kidding\\nthemselves (unless they are part of the small minority who really obey\\nall the rules listed above).\\n\\nOne thing that worries me is the great emotions that this issue\\ncreates.  When you consider the weakness of the Biblical evidence --\\nsome laws in Leviticus, a passage in Rom whose subject matter is\\nreally idolatry rather than homosexuality, and a couple of lists whose\\nwords are ambiguous -- the amount of concern this is raising among\\nChristians seems rather out of proportion.  This should suggest to\\npeople that there are reasons other than simply Biblical involved.\\nThis is true on both sides -- clearly homosexual Christians are as\\nstrongly motivated to find ways of discrediting the Biblical arguments\\nas conservative Christians are to find Biblical arguments.  But I\\ncan\\'t help feeling that the Bible is being used by both sides as a way\\nof justifying attitudes which come from other sources.  This is a\\ndangerous situation for Christians.\\n\\nOn the other side of the issue, I would like to note some problems I\\nhave with the pro-homosexual position as it is commonly presented.\\nOne of the most common arguments is that homosexuality is biologically\\ndetermined.  I.e. \"God made me homosexual\", and I have no choice.  I\\nthink \"God made me homosexual\" is a fine view for people who already\\nbelieve on other grounds that homosexuality is acceptable.  But I\\ndon\\'t see it as an argument for acceptability.\\n\\nMany people think that alcholism is largely biological, and drug\\naddiction may turn out to be as well.  That doesn\\'t mean it\\'s OK.\\nMost of us have particular things we tend to do wrong.  Some people\\nget angry easily.  Others tend to be arrogant.  Others tend to be\\nattraced to women who are married to someone else.  Homosexuality (if\\nwe view it as wrong) wouldn\\'t be different than any of these other\\nthings.  If we are going to follow God, we all end up at one time or\\nanother having to work to overcome bad habits and particular\\ntemptations that cause us problems.  None of us can sit back and say\\nthat because God made us the way we are we can just relax.  As Jesus\\nsaid, we all have to take up our cross daily.  This concept of dying\\nto self (which also appears throughout Paul\\'s letters) seems to\\nsuggest that there are going to be things about ourselves that we we\\nare called on not to accept.  Paul\\'s letters and the experience of\\nChristians throughout history show us that sin is ingrained in us, and\\nthe battle against it is lifelong and difficult.  The fact that\\nhomosexuality is difficult to fight doesn\\'t necessarily say it\\'s OK.\\nMaybe this isn\\'t the place where we have to die to self.  But I\\'d like\\nto make sure that those who think it isn\\'t are fighting the battle\\nsomewhere else, and not rejecting the concept that all Christians have\\nto fight against the deeply engrained habits of sin.\\n'),\n",

And key size is one of the things that can be\\n   verified externally.  Feed lots of random key/input pairs into the\\n   chip, then try flipping random key bits, and see what happens to the\\n   output.  We already know what *should* happen -- about half the output\\n   bits should vary, on average, from a 1-bit key change or input change.\\n\\n   If they were out to build a weak cryptosystem, it might be the case that\\n   some of the bits are much less powerful than others, in the sense that\\n   they only enter into the encryption very late in the game.  By contrast,\\n   DES was designed to use each key bit as early as possible; the 50% output\\n   change rate appears as early as round 5.  Again, though, I don't think\\n   NSA is going to cheat that crudely; they're likely to get caught.\\n\\nConsider a cryptosytem that starts out by XORing bits 23 and 47, and\\nnot using either of these bits except through this XOR. This system\\nmakes early use of every bit. but an exhaustive key search would now\\nonly have 2^79 keys to search. Your test by varying single key bits\\nwouldn't turn up anything interesting.\\n\\n   Remember that they've promised to let a committee of outside experts see\\n   the cryptosystem design.  If you assume something DES-like, a biased\\n   subkey generation schedule will stick out like a sore thumb.\\n\\nThe algorithm I suggest above would stick out like a sore thumb, but\\nI'm sure I could design a system with a more subtle key redundancy\\nwhich was well-hidden, but would still make an exhaustive key search\\ntake far less than 2^80 encryptions.

The one most obviously\\napplicable to cryptography (key selection) is to be able to\\nspecify the \"similarity\" of matches in the data.\\n\\nFor example say you make up a password/phrase of \"qimwe7l\".\\nOf course you rightly suspect that this key itself is not\\nin any dictionary or word list.  But how *close* is it to\\nen entry that could be varied by some \"crack\" program to\\nbrute-force search for it?\\n\\nYou use agrep to find out.

Great for a NSA wannabe\\nto look for your name, terrorists names, special Tagalog or\\nreligious words, etc. in the news or e-mail spool directories.\\n\\nYou can even search for ciphertext by using, say, 30,000\\nrandom three-byte combinations and eliminate all texts that\\ndon\\'t score the X chi-square \\'birthday\\' hits on message size Y.\\n\\nYou think some crypto-terrorist is try to foil you by changing\\nthe pattern on you?

You can\\nalso \"weight\" the relative \"cost\" for substiutions, additions,\\nor deletion errors.  For example, when searching DNA patterns\\nfor a particular protein combination, you might know that\\nsome kinds of damage cause the \"A\" nucelotide to drop out more\\nthan other errors... you could adjust for this bias by setting\\n-Dc where you set the \"deletion cost\" to count as \"c\" errors.\\n\\nA steganographic use (I even used \"agrep -2 \"<steg>eograp\" E\"\\njust now to find the correct spelling!) would be to intentionally\\nintroduce errors of a certain type and magnitude into a plaintext\\nand then later recover the orginal it via an agrep pipe.  Lots of\\npossibilities here when only outlaws can have ciphertext...\\n\\nAlso with agrep\\'s powerful extraction options it makes it easy\\nto abstract the \"hits\" into a useful form.

Hits Stolen have been redefined as \"Plays Kevin\\nBass would not have made.\"\\n\\nOK, I realize that\\'s unfair.  Kevin\\'s probably the victim of pitching staff,\\nfluke shots, and a monster park factor.  But let\\'s put it this way:  If we\\nreplaced every leftfielder in the league with someone with Kevin\\'s 49.4% out\\nmaking ability, how many extra hits would go by?\\n\\nTo try and correlate it to reality a little more, I\\'ve calculated Net\\nHits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league\\naverage fielder would make.  By the same method I\\'ve calculated Net Extra \\nBases (doubles and triples let by).\\n\\nFinally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, or\\nDCON :->.  Basically, it represents the defensive contribution of a player.\\nI add this number to OPS to get DOPS (Defense + Onbase Plus Slug), which\\nshould represent the player\\'s total contribution to the team.

(Flames to /dev/null)\\n\\n--------- Begin Enclosed Article -----------\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tTHE UNABRIDGED SECOND AMENDMENT\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t      by J. Neil Schulman\\n\\nIf you wanted to know all about the Big Bang, you\\'d ring up Carl Sagan,\\nright ?  And if you wanted to know about desert warfare, the man to call\\nwould be Norman Schwarzkopf, no question about it.  But who would you call\\nif you wanted the top expert on American usage, to tell you the meaning\\nof the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution ?\\n\\nThat was the question I asked A.C. Brocki, editorial coordinator of the Los\\nAngeles Unified School District and formerly senior editor at Houghton\\nMifflin Publishers -- who himself had been recommended to me as the\\nforemost expert on English usage in the Los Angeles school system.  Mr.\\nBrocki told me to get in touch with Roy Copperud, a retired professor\\njournalism at the University of Southern California and the author of\\n\"American Usage and Style: The Consensus.\"\\n\\nA little research lent support to Brocki\\'s opinion of Professor Copperud\\'s\\nexpertise.\\n\\nRoy Copperud was a newspaper writer on major dailies for over three decades\\nbefore embarking on a a distinguished 17-year career teaching journalism at\\nUSC.  Since 1952, Copperud has been writing a column dealing with the\\nprofessional aspects of journalism for \"Editor and Publisher\", a weekly\\nmagazine focusing on the journalism field.\\n\\nHe\\'s on the usage panel of the American Heritage Dictionary, and Merriam\\nWebster\\'s Usage Dictionary frequently cites him as an expert.  Copperud\\'s\\nfifth book on usage, \"American Usage and Style: The Consensus,\" has been in\\ncontinuous print from Van Nostrand Reinhold since 1981, and is the winner\\nof the Association of American Publisher\\'s Humanities Award.\\n\\nThat sounds like an expert to me.\\n\\nAfter a brief telephone call to Professor Copperud in which I introduced\\nmyself but did not give him any indication of why I was interested, I sent\\nthe following letter:\\n\\n\"I am writing you to ask you for your professional opinion as an expert in\\nEnglish usage, to analyze the text of the Second Amendment to the United\\nStates Constitution, and extract the intent from the text.\\n\\n\"The text of the Second Amendment is, \\'A well-regulated Militia, being\\nnecessary for the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep\\nand bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\\'\\n\\n\"The debate over this amendment has been whether the first part of the\\nsentence, \\'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a\\nfree State\\', is a restrictive clause or a subordinate clause, with respect\\nto the independent clause containing the subject of the sentence, \\'the\\nright of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\\'\\n\\n\"I would request that your analysis of this sentence not take into\\nconsideration issues of political impact or public policy, but be restricted\\nentirely to a linguistic analysis of its meaning and intent.  Further,\\nsince your professional analysis will likely become part of litigation\\nregarding the consequences of the Second Amendment, I ask that whatever\\nanalysis you make be a professional opinion that you would be willing to\\nstand behind with your reputation, and even be willing to testify under\\noath to support, if necessary.\"\\n\\nMy letter framed several questions about the test of the Second Amendment,\\nthen concluded:\\n\\n\"I realize that I am asking you to take on a major responsibility and task\\nwith this letter.  I am doing so because, as a citizen, I believe it is\\nvitally important to extract the actual meaning of the Second Amendment.\\nWhile I ask that your analysis not be affected by the political importance of\\nits results, I ask that you do this because of that importance.\"\\n\\nAfter several more letters and phone calls, in which we discussed terms for\\nhis doing such an analysis, but in which we never discussed either of our\\nopinions regarding the Second Amendment, gun control, or any other political\\nsubject, Professor Copperud sent me the follow analysis (into which I have\\ninserted my questions for the sake of clarity):\\n\\n[Copperud:] \"The words \\'A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the\\nsecurity of a free state,\\' contrary to the interpretation cited in your\\nletter of July 26, 1991, constitutes a present participle, rather than a\\nclause.  It is used as an adjective, modifying \\'militia,\\' which is\\nfollowed by the main clause of the sentence (subject \\'the right\\', verb\\n\\'shall\\').  The to keep and bear arms is asserted as an essential for\\nmaintaining a militia.\\n\\n\"In reply to your numbered questions:\\n\\n[Schulman:] \"(1) Can the sentence be interpreted to grant the right to keep\\nand bear arms solely to \\'a well-regulated militia\\'?\"\\n\\n[Copperud:] \"(1) The sentence does not restrict the right to keep and bear\\narms, nor does it state or imply possession of the right elsewhere or by\\nothers than the people; it simply makes a positive statement with respect\\nto a right of the people.\"\\n\\n[Schulman:] \"(2) Is \\'the right of the people to keep and bear arms\\' granted\\nby the words of the Second Amendment, or does the Second Amendment assume a\\npreexisting right of the people to keep and bear arms, and merely state\\nthat such right \\'shall not be infringed\\'?\"\\n\\n[Copperud:] \"(2) The right is not granted by the amendment; its existence\\nis assumed.  The thrust of the sentence is that the right shall be\\npreserved inviolate for the sake of ensuring a militia.\"\\n\\n[Schulman:] \"(3) Is the right of the people to keep and bear arms\\nconditioned upon whether or not a well regulated militia, is, in fact\\nnecessary to the security of a free State, and if that condition is not\\nexisting, is the statement \\'the right of the people to keep and bear Arms,\\nshall not be infringed\\' null and void?\"\\n\\n[Copperud:] \"(3) No such condition is expressed or implied.  The right to\\nkeep and bear arms is not said by the amendment to depend on the existence\\nof a militia.  No condition is stated or implied as to the relation of the\\nright to keep and bear arms and to the necessity of a well-regulated\\nmilitia as a requisite to the security of a free state.  The right to keep\\nand bear arms is deemed unconditional by the entire sentence.\"\\n\\n[Schulman:] \"(4) Does the clause \\'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary\\nto the security of a free State,\\' grant a right to the government to place\\nconditions on the \\'right of the people to keep and bear arms,\\' or is such\\nright deemed unconditional by the meaning of the entire sentence?\"\\n\\n[Copperud:] \"(4) The right is assumed to exist and to be unconditional, as\\npreviously stated.  It is invoked here specifically for the sake of the\\nmilitia.\"\\n\\n[Schulman:] \"(5) Which of the following does the phrase \\'well-regulated\\nmilitia\\' mean: \\'well-equipped\\', \\'well-organized,\\' \\'well-drilled,\\'\\n\\'well-educated,\\' or \\'subject to regulations of a superior authority\\'?\"\\n\\n[Copperud:] \"(5) The phrase means \\'subject to regulations of a superior\\nauthority;\\' this accords with the desire of the writers for civilian\\ncontrol over the military.\"\\n\\n[Schulman:] \"(6) (If at all possible, I would ask you to take account the\\nchanged meanings of words, or usage, since that sentence was written 200\\nyears ago, but not take into account historical interpretations of the\\nintents of the authors, unless those issues can be clearly separated.\"\\n\\n[Copperud:] \"To the best of my knowledge, there has been no change in the\\nmeaning of words or in usage that would affect the meaning of the\\namendment.  If it were written today, it might be put: \"Since a\\nwell-regulated militia is necessary tot he security of a free state, the\\nright of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be abridged.\\'\\n\\n[Schulman:] \"As a \\'scientific control\\' on this analysis, I would also\\nappreciate it if you could compare your analysis of the text of the Second\\nAmendment to the following sentence,\\n\\n\"A well-schooled electorate, being necessary to the security of a free\\nState, the right of the people to keep and read Books, shall not be\\ninfringed.\\'\\n\\n\"My questions for the usage analysis of this sentence would be,\\n\\n\"(1) Is the grammatical structure and usage of this sentence and the way\\nthe words modify each other, identical to the Second Amendment\\'s sentence?;\\nand\\n\\n\"(2) Could this sentence be interpreted to restrict \\'the right of the people\\nto keep and read Books\\' _only_ to \\'a well-educated electorate\\' -- for\\nexample, registered voters with a high-school diploma?\"\\n\\n[Copperud:] \"(1) Your \\'scientific control\\' sentence precisely parallels the\\namendment in grammatical structure.\\n\\n\"(2) There is nothing in your sentence that either indicates or implies the\\npossibility of a restricted interpretation.\"\\n\\nProfessor Copperud had only one additional comment, which he placed in his\\ncover letter: \"With well-known human curiosity, I made some speculative\\nefforts to decide how the material might be used, but was unable to reach\\nany conclusion.\"\\n\\nSo now we have been told by one of the top experts on American usage what\\nmany knew all along: the Constitution of the United States unconditionally\\nprotects the people\\'s right to keep and bear arms, forbidding all\\ngovernments formed under the Constitution from abridging that right.\\n\\nAs I write this, the attempted coup against constitutional government in the\\nSoviet Union has failed, apparently because the will of the people in that\\npart of the world to be free from capricious tyranny is stronger than the\\nold guard\\'s desire to maintain a monopoly on dictatorial power.\\n\\nAnd here in the United States, elected lawmakers, judges, and appointed\\nofficials who are pledged to defend the Constitution of the United States\\nignore, marginalize, or prevaricate about the Second Amendment routinely.\\nAmerican citizens are put in American prisons for carrying arms, owning\\narms of forbidden sorts, or failing to satisfy bureaucratic requirements\\nregarding the owning and carrying of firearms -- all of which is an\\nabridgement of the unconditional right of the people to keep and bear arms,\\nguaranteed by the Constitution.\\n\\nAnd even the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), staunch defender of the\\nrest of the Bill of Rights, stands by and does nothing.\\n\\nit seems it is up to those who believe in the right to keep and bear arms to\\npreserve that right.  no one else will.  No one else can.  Will we beg our\\nelected representatives not to take away our rights, and continue regarding\\nthem as representing us if they do?  Will we continue obeying judges who\\ndecide that the Second Amendment doesn\\'t mean what it says it means but\\nmeans whatever they say it means in their Orwellian doublespeak ?\\n\\nOr will be simply keep and bear the arms of our choice, as the Constitution\\nof the United States promises us we can, and pledge that we will defend\\nthat promise with our lives, our fortuned, and our sacred honor ?\\n\\n(C) 1991 by The New Gun Week and Second Amendment Foundation.\\nInformational reproduction of the entire article is hereby authorized\\nprovided the author, The New Gun Week and Second Amendment Foundation are\\ncredited.

Well,\\nthink again.  Sometimes the only real support out there is what Apple\\ncomputer users can give to each other.  For another example, read on:\\n\\nIn the March 15th issue of _MacWeek_, Ric Ford described a two-year effort\\nby Liam Breck to document and bring to Apple\\'s attention a problem with\\ncertain defective mice.  At random, the switches on these mice \"stick\" in\\nthe down position until clicked a second time, apparently regardless of the\\nmachine they are used with or the system software involved. Most of the\\nreported problem mice were manufactured in Malaysia and have an FCC ID of\\nBCGA65431. You\\'ll recognize this \"sticky button\" symptom immediately if you\\nhave such a mouse: the problem is intermittent, but it\\'s not subtle.\\n\\nLiam Breck recently gave up trying to document this problem, and instead \\nsuggested that people contact Apple\\'s Customer Assistance Center directly\\n(_MacWeek_ 4/5/93 p. 64). When I called Apple on March 23rd and described\\nmy defective mouse, I was eventually given a case number (F83Y) and told\\nApple would replace this mouse even though it is a few months out of\\nwarranty.  After waiting for three weeks, I called back today wondering\\nwhere my new mouse was. This time, I was told that Apple had decided the\\nserial number on my mouse (MB13831FC25) is not within the (undisclosed)\\nrange Apple is willing to replace, and there is nothing I can do about it.\\n\\nNothing, that is, unless enough people complain about this problem to make\\nit worth Apple\\'s while to fix or replace the entire lot of defective mice.\\nPlease, if you have one of these mice, I NEED YOUR HELP! Don\\'t assume you\\nknow what causes the problem (there are _lots_ of theories) and start\\nhacking around inside your hundred-dollar mouse. Instead, let Apple do it.\\nPlease take five minutes to CALL APPLE RIGHT NOW at:\\n\\n                  United States      1-800-776-2333\\n                  Canada             800-665-2775\\n                  UK and Europe      33-1-49-01-49-01\\n                  Australia          61-2-452-8000\\n                  Japan and Pacific  81-3-5411-8500\\n\\nIf the number isn\\'t toll-free, call collect.  Describe the problem and ask\\nfor a replacement mouse.  Even if they refuse, insist that they register\\nthe details of your case, including your mouse\\'s serial number.  Be firm.\\n\\nNetwork managers and user-group leaders especially, please query your user\\nbases. Everyone ask your friends and colleagues.  Please don\\'t send mail to\\nme or post yet another \"sticky-button\" report, CALL APPLE DIRECTLY!  If\\nenough victims take the trouble to report this well-known problem, Apple\\nwill eventually be forced to respond.  If Apple continues to find it easy\\nto stone-wall on this issue, don\\'t expect them to offer support when the\\nnext, potentially more serious Mac defect is uncovered.\\n\\n-- Bill Sloan\\n'),\n",

But do you really believe that this is the reason ?\\n|> Could you provide evidence that this is the case and that it\\n|> serves no other purpose ?\\n\\nA number of points.  You are making assumptions about the manner\\nin which the cards are used.  True, by law, all residents, citizens,\\nand tourists must carry a form of identification with them.  For\\ncitizens, the standard ID is the ID card.  The purpose this serves\\non a daily basis, wherein they are presented at public places,\\nis for the purpose of identifying the bearer.  This takes place\\nin banks (cashing checks), post offices (registered mail and such), etc...\\nQuite frankly, it was rare that I ever had to present my ID card\\nfor such activities more than once per week.  There is no law or\\nrequirement that forces people to wave their ID cards in public.\\nFurthermore, none of the services I outlined discriminate against\\nthe bearer in any manner by having access to this information.\\n\\nThe only case that I can think of in which the Le\\'um field might\\nbe taken into account is during interaction with the police,\\nbased upon the scenario.  In general though, arab citizens are\\nclearly recognizable, as are non-arabs. Your argument therefore\\nbecomes moot unless you can provide an example of how this field\\nis being used to discriminate against them officially.\\n\\n\\n|> In the answer to my second questions, concerning the fact that\\n|> Israel has no fixed borders, you state that Israel\\'s borders were\\n|> \\'shaped and reshaped by both war and peace\\'. According to what I\\n|> read, the first Zionists in the beginning of the Century, had\\n|> plans for the Jewish State to extend into what is Lebanon and into\\n|> Transjordan (Jordan). I also read that it was the express wish of\\n|> Ben-Gurion to not declare Israel\\'s borders, when Israel was\\n|> established, as this might restrict Israel\\'s opportunities for\\n|> later expansion. Israel often claims it right of existence on the\\n|> fact that Jews lived there 2000 years ago or that God promised the\\n|> land to them. But according to biblical sources, the area God\\n|> promised would extend all the way to Iraq. And what were the\\n|> borders in biblical times which Israel considers proper to use\\n|> today ?  Finally, if Israel wants peace, why can\\'t it declare what\\n|> it considers its legitimate and secure borders, which might be a\\n|> base for negotiations? Having all the above facts in mind, one\\n|> cannot blame Arab countries to fear Israeli expansionism, as a\\n|> number of wars have proved (1948, 1956, 1967, 1982).\\n\\nI take issue with your assertions.  I think that Arab countries\\ndo know that they have nothing to fear from \"Israeli expansionism\".\\nMilitarily, Israel is not capable of holding onto large tracts of\\nland under occupation to a hostile, armed, and insurgent population for a\\nsustained period of time.  As is, the intifada is heavily taxing\\nthe Israeli economy.  Proof of this can be seen in the Israeli\\nwithdrawal from Lebanon.  Israeli troops pulled back from the\\nAwali, and later from the Litani, in order to control the minimal\\nstrip needed to keep towns out of range of Katyusha missile fire.\\nPublic opinion in Israel has turned towards settling the intifada\\nvia territorial concessions.  The Israel public is sufferring from\\nbattle fatigue of sorts and the gov\\'t is aware of it.\\n\\nWith regards to borders, let me state the following.  I may not agree\\nwith the manner in which negotiations are being held, however the crux\\nof the matter is that everyone either makes or refrains from stating\\na starting position.  The arab parties have called for total withdrawal\\nand a return to pre-48 borders.  If Israel were to state large borders,\\nthe negotiations might never get under way.  If Israel were to state\\nsmaller borders, then the arab countries might try and force even smaller\\nborders during the negotiations.  I think that leaving the matter to be\\nsettled by negotiations and peace treaties is infinitely more realistic\\nand sensible.\\n\\n|> Your answer to my third question is typical of a Stalinist public\\n|> official. I don\\'t think your answer is honest.  You refer me to\\n|> Vanunu\\'s revelations about Israel\\'s nuclear arsenal without\\n|> evaluating the truthfullness of his revelations. Now if he said\\n|> the truth, then why should he been punished, and if he lied, why\\n|> should he be punished? I would appreciate more honesty.\\n\\nYour statement is typical of the simple minded naivety of a \"center for\\npolicy research\".  Whether or not all of Vanunu\\'s revelations were true has no\\nbearing on the fact that some were.  For disclosing \"state secrets\"\\nafter having signed contracts and forms with the understanding that\\nsaid secrets are not to be made public, one should be punished.\\nAs to which were and which weren\\'t, I am under no moral obligation\\nto disclose that - quite the reverse in fact.\\nHe was taken to court, tried, and found guilty.  You may take issue\\nwith a number of things but clearly you have no understanding of the\\nconcept of \"Secrets of state\", something which every democratic govt\\nhas.\\n\\n|> Somebody provided an answer to the fourth question, concerning\\n|> \\'hidden prisoners\\' in Israeli prisons. He posted an article from\\n|> Ma\\'ariv documenting such cases.  It seems that such prisoners do\\n|> exist in Israel. What do you think about that ?\\n\\nI noticed that he was documenting the fact that such prisoners could exist\\nmore than he documented the fact that they do exist.  The CLU noted,\\nwhich you evidently did not pay attention to, that they know of no such\\nreports or cases.  I am sorry to tell you but in a country of 4 mill,\\nas tightly knit as Israel, even if the matter of the arrest was not\\nmade public, within a relatively short time frame, most people would know\\nabout it.  My own feelings are that the matter of the arrest should be\\nmade public unless a court order is issued allowing a delay of X hours.\\nThis would be granted only if a judge could be convinced that an\\nannouncement would cause irreparable harm to the ongoing investigation.\\n\\n|> You imply that my questions show bias and are formulated in such a\\n|> way to \\'cast aspersions upon Israel\\'. Such terms have often been\\n|> used by the Soviet Union against dissidents: They call the Soviet\\n|> Union into disrepute.

This is a sign of weakness, not of strength.\\n\\nWell, I am sorry to say that your questions are slanted.  Such\\nquestions are often termed \"tabloid journalism\" and are not\\ndisturbing because they avoid any attempt at objectivity.\\nSuch questions were often used during the McCarthy era as\\na basis for the witch-hunts that took place then.  To use\\nyour own example, these questions might have been lifted\\nfrom the format used by Stalinist prosecutors that were looking\\nfor small bits of evidence that they could distort and portray\\nas a larger and dirtier picture.\\n\\nMy answers were not any more \"hysterical\" than the questions\\nthemselves.  The problem is not that the q\\'s were provocative,\\nit was that they were selective in their fact seeking.  You\\nfall into the same category of those who seek \"yes\" \"no\" answers\\nwhen the real answer is \"of sorts\".\\nI suspect that as long as the answers to these questions is not an\\nunequivocal NO, you would remain unsatified and choose to interprete\\nthem as you see fit.  A sign of strength is the ability to look\\nYou remind me of those mistaken environmentalists who once advocated\\nculling wolves because of the cruelty to deer, only to find that they\\nhad broken the food chain and wreaked havoc upon the very environment\\nthey sought to protect.

Whilst I\\nhave tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues, you\\nshould always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint.  I\\nwould encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions; some\\nrelevant books are listed in a companion article.\\n\\nTo provide a sense of cohesion and progression, I have presented this article\\nas an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist.  All the\\nquestions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been cropped\\nup repeatedly on alt.atheism since the newsgroup was created.  Some other\\nfrequently asked questions are answered in a companion article.\\n\\nPlease note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questions\\nposed from a Christian viewpoint.  This is because the FAQ files reflect\\nquestions which have actually been asked, and it is predominantly Christians\\nwho proselytize on alt.atheism.\\n\\nSo when I talk of religion, I am talking primarily about religions such as\\nChristianity, Judaism and Islam, which involve some sort of superhuman divine\\nbeing.  Much of the discussion will apply to other religions, but some of it\\nmay not.\\n\\n\"What is atheism?\"\\n\\nAtheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God.\\nSome atheists go further, and believe that God does not exist.  The former is\\noften referred to as the \"weak atheist\" position, and the latter as \"strong\\natheism\".\\n\\nIt is important to note the difference between these two positions.  \"Weak\\natheism\" is simple scepticism; disbelief in the existence of God.  \"Strong\\natheism\" is a positive belief that God does not exist.  Please do not\\nfall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are \"strong atheists\".\\n\\nSome atheists believe in the non-existence of all Gods; others limit their\\natheism to specific Gods, such as the Christian God, rather than making\\nflat-out denials.\\n\\n\"But isn\\'t disbelieving in God the same thing as believing he doesn\\'t exist?\"\\n\\nDefinitely not.  Disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believe\\nit to be true.  Not believing that something is true is not equivalent to\\nbelieving that it is false; one may simply have no idea whether it is true or\\nnot.  Which brings us to agnosticism.\\n\\n\"What is agnosticism then?\"\\n\\nThe term \\'agnosticism\\' was coined by Professor Huxley at a meeting of the\\nMetaphysical Society in 1876.  He defined an agnostic as someone who\\ndisclaimed (\"strong\") atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of things\\nmust be some cause unknown and unknowable.\\n\\nThus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know for\\nsure whether God exists.\\n\\nWords are slippery things, and language is inexact.  Beware of assuming that\\nyou can work out someone\\'s philosophical point of view simply from the fact\\nthat she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic.  For example, many people\\nuse agnosticism to mean \"weak atheism\", and use the word \"atheism\" only when\\nreferring to \"strong atheism\".\\n\\nBeware also that because the word \"atheist\" has so many shades of meaning, it\\nis very difficult to generalize about atheists.  About all you can say for\\nsure is that atheists don\\'t believe in God.  For example, it certainly isn\\'t\\nthe case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find out\\nabout the universe.\\n\\n\"So what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheism?\"\\n\\nThere are many philosophical justifications for atheism.  To find out why a\\nparticular person chooses to be an atheist, it\\'s best to ask her.\\n\\nMany atheists feel that the idea of God as presented by the major religions\\nis essentially self-contradictory, and that it is logically impossible that\\nsuch a God could exist.  Others are atheists through scepticism, because they\\nsee no evidence that God exists.\\n\\n\"But isn\\'t it impossible to prove the non-existence of something?\"\\n\\nThere are many counter-examples to such a statement.  For example, it is\\nquite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger than\\nall other prime numbers.  Of course, this deals with well-defined objects\\nobeying well-defined rules.  Whether Gods or universes are similarly\\nwell-defined is a matter for debate.\\n\\nHowever, assuming for the moment that the existence of a God is not provably\\nimpossible, there are still subtle reasons for assuming the non-existence of\\nGod.  If we assume that something does not exist, it is always possible to\\nshow that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counter-example.\\n\\nIf on the other hand we assume that something does exist, and if the thing in\\nquestion is not provably impossible, showing that the assumption is invalid\\nmay require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thing\\nmight be found, to show that it isn\\'t there.  Such an exhaustive search is\\noften impractical or impossible.  There is no such problem with largest\\nprimes, because we can prove that they don\\'t exist.\\n\\nTherefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not exist\\nunless we have evidence that they do.  Even theists follow this rule most of\\nthe time; they don\\'t believe in unicorns, even though they can\\'t conclusively\\nprove that no unicorns exist anywhere.\\n\\nTo assume that God exists is to make an assumption which probably cannot be\\ntested.  We cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere God might be to\\nprove that he doesn\\'t exist anywhere.  So the sceptical atheist assumes by\\ndefault that God does not exist, since that is an assumption we can test.\\n\\nThose who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of God\\nexists; instead, they generally restrict their claims so as to cover\\nvarieties of God described by followers of various religions.  So whilst it\\nmay be impossible to prove conclusively that no God exists, it may be\\npossible to prove that (say) a God as described by a particular religious\\nbook does not exist.  It may even be possible to prove that no God described\\nby any present-day religion exists.\\n\\nIn practice, believing that no God described by any religion exists is very\\nclose to believing that no God exists.  However, it is sufficiently different\\nthat counter-arguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind of\\nGod are not really applicable.\\n\\n\"But what if God is essentially non-detectable?\"\\n\\nIf God interacts with our universe in any way, the effects of his interaction\\nmust be measurable.  Hence his interaction with our universe must be\\ndetectable.\\n\\nIf God is essentially non-detectable, it must therefore be the case that he\\ndoes not interact with our universe in any way.  Many atheists would argue\\nthat if God does not interact with our universe at all, it is of no\\nimportance whether he exists or not.\\n\\nIf the Bible is to be believed, God was easily detectable by the Israelites.\\nSurely he should still be detectable today?\\n\\nNote that I am not demanding that God interact in a scientifically\\nverifiable, physical way.  It must surely be possible to perceive some\\neffect caused by his presence, though; otherwise, how can I distinguish him\\nfrom all the other things that don\\'t exist?\\n\\n\"OK, you may think there\\'s a philosophical justification for atheism, but\\n isn\\'t it still a religious belief?\"\\n\\nOne of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is \"the\\nredefinition game\".  The cynical view of this game is as follows:\\n\\nPerson A begins by making a contentious statement.  When person B points out\\nthat it can\\'t be true, person A gradually re-defines the words he used in the\\nstatement until he arrives at something person B is prepared to accept.  He\\nthen records the statement, along with the fact that person B has agreed to\\nit, and continues.  Eventually A uses the statement as an \"agreed fact\", but\\nuses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscure\\nredefinitions originally needed to get B to agree to it.  Rather than be seen\\nto be apparently inconsistent, B will tend to play along.\\n\\nThe point of this digression is that the answer to the question \"Isn\\'t\\natheism a religious belief?\" depends crucially upon what is meant by\\n\"religious\".  \"Religion\" is generally characterized by belief in a superhuman\\ncontrolling power -- especially in some sort of God -- and by faith and\\nworship.\\n\\n[ It\\'s worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of Buddhism are not\\n  \"religion\" according to such a definition. ]\\n\\nAtheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power, nor is it\\ncategorized by worship in any meaningful sense.  Widening the definition of\\n\"religious\" to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects of\\nhuman behaviour suddenly becoming classed as \"religious\" as well -- such as\\nscience, politics, and watching TV.\\n\\n\"OK, so it\\'s not a religion.  But surely belief in atheism (or science) is\\n still just an act of faith, like religion is?\"\\n\\nFirstly, it\\'s not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something one\\nactually believes in.\\n\\nSecondly, it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions to\\nmake some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience.  Most atheists\\ntry to adopt as few core beliefs as possible; and even those are subject to\\nquestioning if experience throws them into doubt.\\n\\nScience has a number of core assumptions.  For example, it is generally\\nassumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers.  These are\\nthe sort of core assumptions atheists make.  If such basic ideas are called\\n\"acts of faith\", then almost everything we know must be said to be based on\\nacts of faith, and the term loses its meaning.\\n\\nFaith is more often used to refer to complete, certain belief in something.\\nAccording to such a definition, atheism and science are certainly not acts of\\nfaith.  Of course, individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic as\\nreligious followers when claiming that something is \"certain\".  This is not a\\ngeneral tendency, however; there are many atheists who would be reluctant to\\nstate with certainty that the universe exists.\\n\\nFaith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proof.\\nSceptical atheism certainly doesn\\'t fit that definition, as sceptical atheism\\nhas no beliefs.  Strong atheism is closer, but still doesn\\'t really match, as\\neven the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data (or\\nthe lack of it) when asserting that God does not exist.\\n\\n\"If atheism is not religious, surely it\\'s anti-religious?\"\\n\\nIt is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either \"for\" or\\n\"against\", \"friend\" or \"enemy\".  The truth is not so clear-cut.\\n\\nAtheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism; in that sense,\\nit can be said to be \"anti-religion\".  However, when religious believers\\nspeak of atheists being \"anti-religious\" they usually mean that the atheists\\nhave some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theists.\\n\\nThis categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfair.\\nAtheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrum.\\n\\nMost atheists take a \"live and let live\" attitude.  Unless questioned, they\\nwill not usually mention their atheism, except perhaps to close friends.  Of\\ncourse, this may be in part because atheism is not \"socially acceptable\" in\\nmany countries.\\n\\nA few atheists are quite anti-religious, and may even try to \"convert\" others\\nwhen possible.  Historically, such anti-religious atheists have made little\\nimpact on society outside the Eastern Bloc countries.\\n\\n(To digress slightly: the Soviet Union was originally dedicated to separation\\nof church and state, just like the USA.  Soviet citizens were legally free to\\nworship as they wished.  The institution of \"state atheism\" came about when\\nStalin took control of the Soviet Union and tried to destroy the churches in\\norder to gain complete power over the population.)\\n\\nSome atheists are quite vocal about their beliefs, but only where they see\\nreligion encroaching on matters which are not its business -- for example,\\nthe government of the USA.  Such individuals are usually concerned that\\nchurch and state should remain separate.\\n\\n\"But if you don\\'t allow religion to have a say in the running of the state,\\n surely that\\'s the same as state atheism?\"\\n\\nThe principle of the separation of church and state is that the state shall\\nnot legislate concerning matters of religious belief.  In particular, it\\nmeans not only that the state cannot promote one religion at the expense of\\nanother, but also that it cannot promote any belief which is religious in\\nnature.\\n\\nReligions can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matters.  For\\nexample, religious believers have historically been responsible for\\nencouraging many political reforms.  Even today, many organizations\\ncampaigning for an increase in spending on foreign aid are founded as\\nreligious campaigns.  So long as they campaign concerning secular matters,\\nand so long as they do not discriminate on religious grounds, most atheists\\nare quite happy to see them have their say.\\n\\n\"What about prayer in schools? If there\\'s no God, why do you care if people\\n pray?\"\\n\\nBecause people who do pray are voters and lawmakers, and tend to do things\\nthat those who don\\'t pray can\\'t just ignore.  Also, Christian prayer in\\nschools is intimidating to non-Christians, even if they are told that they\\nneed not join in.  The diversity of religious and non-religious belief means\\nthat it is impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will be\\nacceptable to all those present at any public event.\\n\\nAlso, non-prayers tend to have friends and family who pray.  It is reasonable\\nto care about friends and family wasting their time, even without other\\nmotives.\\n\\n\"You mentioned Christians who campaign for increased foreign aid.  What about\\n atheists?  Why aren\\'t there any atheist charities or hospitals?  Don\\'t\\n atheists object to the religious charities?\"\\n\\nThere are many charities without religious purpose that atheists can\\ncontribute to.  Some atheists contribute to religious charities as well, for\\nthe sake of the practical good they do.  Some atheists even do voluntary work\\nfor charities founded on a theistic basis.\\n\\nMost atheists seem to feel that atheism isn\\'t worth shouting about in\\nconnection with charity.  To them, atheism is just a simple, obvious everyday\\nmatter, and so is charity.  Many feel that it\\'s somewhat cheap, not to say\\nself-righteous, to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular set\\nof religious beliefs.\\n\\nTo \"weak\" atheists, building a hospital to say \"I do not believe in God\" is a\\nrather strange idea; it\\'s rather like holding a party to say \"Today is not my\\nbirthday\".  Why the fuss?  Atheism is rarely evangelical.\\n\\n\"You said atheism isn\\'t anti-religious.  But is it perhaps a backlash against\\n one\\'s upbringing, a way of rebelling?\"\\n\\nPerhaps it is, for some.  But many people have parents who do not attempt to\\nforce any religious (or atheist) ideas upon them, and many of those people\\nchoose to call themselves atheists.\\n\\nIt\\'s also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion as a\\nbacklash against an atheist upbringing, as a way of being different.  On the\\nother hand, many people choose religion as a way of conforming to the\\nexpectations of others.\\n\\nOn the whole, we can\\'t conclude much about whether atheism or religion are\\nbacklash or conformism; although in general, people have a tendency to go\\nalong with a group rather than act or think independently.\\n\\n\"How do atheists differ from religious people?\"\\n\\nThey don\\'t believe in God.  That\\'s all there is to it.\\n\\nAtheists may listen to heavy metal -- backwards, even -- or they may prefer a\\nVerdi Requiem, even if they know the words.  They may wear Hawaiian shirts,\\nthey may dress all in black, they may even wear orange robes.  (Many\\nBuddhists lack a belief in any sort of God.)  Some atheists even carry a copy\\nof the Bible around -- for arguing against, of course!\\n\\nWhoever you are, the chances are you have met several atheists without\\nrealising it.  Atheists are usually unexceptional in behaviour and\\nappearance.\\n\\n\"Unexceptional? But aren\\'t atheists less moral than religious people?\"\\n\\nThat depends.  If you define morality as obedience to God, then of course\\natheists are less moral as they don\\'t obey any God.  But usually when one\\ntalks of morality, one talks of what is acceptable (\"right\") and unacceptable\\n(\"wrong\") behaviour within society.\\n\\nHumans are social animals, and to be maximally successful they must\\nco-operate with each other.  This is a good enough reason to discourage most\\natheists from \"anti-social\" or \"immoral\" behaviour, purely for the purposes\\nof self-preservation.\\n\\nMany atheists behave in a \"moral\" or \"compassionate\" way simply because they\\nfeel a natural tendency to empathize with other humans.  So why do they care\\nwhat happens to others?  They don\\'t know, they simply are that way.\\n\\nNaturally, there are some people who behave \"immorally\" and try to use\\natheism to justify their actions.  However, there are equally many people who\\nbehave \"immorally\" and then try to use religious beliefs to justify their\\nactions.  For example:\\n\\n  \"Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Jesus Christ\\n   came into the world to save sinners...  But for that very reason, I was\\n   shown mercy so that in me...  Jesus Christ might display His unlimited\\n   patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive\\n   eternal life.  Now to the king eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God,\\n   be honor and glory forever and ever.\"\\n\\nThe above quote is from a statement made to the court on February 17th 1992\\nby Jeffrey Dahmer, the notorious cannibal serial killer of Milwaukee,\\nWisconsin.  It seems that for every atheist mass-murderer, there is a\\nreligious mass-murderer.  But what of more trivial morality?\\n\\n   A survey conducted by the Roper Organization found that behavior\\n   deteriorated after \"born again\" experiences.  While only 4% of respondents\\n   said they had driven intoxicated before being \"born again,\" 12% had done\\n   so after conversion.  Similarly, 5% had used illegal drugs before\\n   conversion, 9% after.  Two percent admitted to engaging in illicit sex\\n   before salvation; 5% after.\\n                                [\"Freethought Today\", September 1991, p. 12.]\\n\\nSo it seems that at best, religion does not have a monopoly on moral\\nbehaviour.\\n\\n\"Is there such a thing as atheist morality?\"\\n\\nIf you mean \"Is there such a thing as morality for atheists?\", then the\\nanswer is yes, as explained above.  Many atheists have ideas about morality\\nwhich are at least as strong as those held by religious people.\\n\\nIf you mean \"Does atheism have a characteristic moral code?\", then the answer\\nis no.  Atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a person\\nwill behave.  Most atheists follow many of the same \"moral rules\" as theists,\\nbut for different reasons.  Atheists view morality as something created by\\nhumans, according to the way humans feel the world \\'ought\\' to work, rather\\nthan seeing it as a set of rules decreed by a supernatural being.\\n\\n\"Then aren\\'t atheists just theists who are denying God?\"\\n\\nA study by the Freedom From Religion Foundation found that over 90% of the\\natheists who responded became atheists because religion did not work for\\nthem.  They had found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatible\\nwith what they observed around them.\\n\\nAtheists are not unbelievers through ignorance or denial; they are\\nunbelievers through choice.  The vast majority of them have spent time\\nstudying one or more religions, sometimes in very great depth.  They have\\nmade a careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefs.\\n\\nThis decision may, of course, be an inevitable consequence of that\\nindividual\\'s personality.  For a naturally sceptical person, the choice\\nof atheism is often the only one that makes sense, and hence the only\\nchoice that person can honestly make.\\n\\n\"But don\\'t atheists want to believe in God?\"\\n\\nAtheists live their lives as though there is nobody watching over them.  Many\\nof them have no desire to be watched over, no matter how good-natured the\\n\"Big Brother\" figure might be.\\n\\nSome atheists would like to be able to believe in God -- but so what? Should\\none believe things merely because one wants them to be true?  The risks of\\nsuch an approach should be obvious.  Atheists often decide that wanting to\\nbelieve something is not enough; there must be evidence for the belief.\\n\\n\"But of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of God -- they are\\n unwilling in their souls to see!\"\\n\\nMany, if not most atheists were previously religious.  As has been explained\\nabove, the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that God\\nexists.  Many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach God.\\n\\nOf course, it is true that some atheists lack an open mind; but assuming that\\nall atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closed-minded.\\nComments such as \"Of course God is there, you just aren\\'t looking properly\"\\nare likely to be viewed as patronizing.\\n\\nCertainly, if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it is\\nvital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they are\\nbeing sincere if they say that they have searched for God.  If you are not\\nwilling to believe that they are basically telling the truth, debate is\\nfutile.\\n\\n\"Isn\\'t the whole of life completely pointless to an atheist?\"\\n\\nMany atheists live a purposeful life.  They decide what they think gives\\nmeaning to life, and they pursue those goals.  They try to make their lives\\ncount, not by wishing for eternal life, but by having an influence on other\\npeople who will live on.  For example, an atheist may dedicate his life to\\npolitical reform, in the hope of leaving his mark on history.\\n\\nIt is a natural human tendency to look for \"meaning\" or \"purpose\" in random\\nevents.  However, it is by no means obvious that \"life\" is the sort of thing\\nthat has a \"meaning\".\\n\\nTo put it another way, not everything which looks like a question is actually\\na sensible thing to ask.  Some atheists believe that asking \"What is the\\nmeaning of life?\" is as silly as asking \"What is the meaning of a cup of\\ncoffee?\".  They believe that life has no purpose or meaning, it just is.\\n\\n\"So how do atheists find comfort in time of danger?\"\\n\\nThere are many ways of obtaining comfort; from family, friends, or even pets.\\nOr on a less spiritual level, from food or drink or TV.\\n\\nThat may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger, but so\\nwhat?  Should individuals believe in things because they are comforting, or\\nshould they face reality no matter how harsh it might be?\\n\\nIn the end, it\\'s a decision for the individual concerned.  Most atheists are\\nunable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely because\\nit makes them feel comfortable.  They put truth before comfort, and consider\\nthat if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy, that\\'s just\\nhard luck.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrong?\"\\n\\nThe short answer is \"No, do you?\"\\n\\nMany atheists have been atheists for years.  They have encountered many\\narguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of God, but they have\\nfound all of it to be invalid or inconclusive.\\n\\nThousands of years of religious belief haven\\'t resulted in any good proof of\\nthe existence of God.  Atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikely\\nto be proved wrong in the immediate future, and they stop worrying about it.\\n\\n\"So why should theists question their beliefs? Don\\'t the same arguments\\n apply?\"\\n\\nNo, because the beliefs being questioned are not similar.  Weak atheism is\\nthe sceptical \"default position\" to take; it asserts nothing.  Strong atheism\\nis a negative belief.  Theism is a very strong positive belief.\\n\\nAtheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefs\\nbecause of the very real harm they can cause -- not just to the believers,\\nbut to everyone else.\\n\\n\"What sort of harm?\"\\n\\nReligion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind.  It\\'s not\\njust a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildings;\\nthink of all the time and effort spent building churches, praying, and so on.\\nImagine how that effort could be better spent.\\n\\nMany theists believe in miracle healing.  There have been plenty of instances\\nof ill people being \"healed\" by a priest, ceasing to take the medicines\\nprescribed to them by doctors, and dying as a result.  Some theists have died\\nbecause they have refused blood transfusions on religious grounds.\\n\\nIt is arguable that the Catholic Church\\'s opposition to birth control -- and\\ncondoms in particular -- is increasing the problem of overpopulation in many\\nthird-world countries and contributing to the spread of AIDS world-wide.\\n\\nReligious believers have been known to murder their children rather than\\nallow their children to become atheists or marry someone of a different\\nreligion.\\n\\n\"Those weren\\'t REAL believers.  They just claimed to be believers as some\\n sort of excuse.\"\\n\\nWhat makes a real believer?  There are so many One True Religions it\\'s hard\\nto tell.  Look at Christianity: there are many competing groups, all\\nconvinced that they are the only true Christians.  Sometimes they even fight\\nand kill each other.  How is an atheist supposed to decide who\\'s a REAL\\nChristian and who isn\\'t, when even the major Christian churches like the\\nCatholic Church and the Church of England can\\'t decide amongst themselves?\\n\\nIn the end, most atheists take a pragmatic view, and decide that anyone who\\ncalls himself a Christian, and uses Christian belief or dogma to justify his\\nactions, should be considered a Christian.  Maybe some of those Christians\\nare just perverting Christian teaching for their own ends -- but surely if\\nthe Bible can be so readily used to support un-Christian acts it can\\'t be\\nmuch of a moral code? If the Bible is the word of God, why couldn\\'t he have\\nmade it less easy to misinterpret? And how do you know that your beliefs\\naren\\'t a perversion of what your God intended?\\n\\nIf there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the Bible, then why\\nshould an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your say-so?\\nSorry, but if someone claims that he believes in Jesus and that he murdered\\nothers because Jesus and the Bible told him to do so, we must call him a\\nChristian.\\n\\n\"Obviously those extreme sorts of beliefs should be questioned.  But since\\n nobody has ever proved that God does not exist, it must be very unlikely\\n that more basic religious beliefs, shared by all faiths, are nonsense.\"\\n\\nThat does not hold, because as was pointed out at the start of this dialogue,\\npositive assertions concerning the existence of entities are inherently much\\nharder to disprove than negative ones.  Nobody has ever proved that unicorns\\ndon\\'t exist, but that doesn\\'t make it unlikely that they are myths.\\n\\nIt is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default than\\nit is to hold a positive assertion by default.  Of course, \"weak\" atheists\\nwould argue that asserting nothing is better still.\\n\\n\"Well, if atheism\\'s so great, why are there so many theists?\"\\n\\nUnfortunately, the popularity of a belief has little to do with how \"correct\"\\nit is, or whether it \"works\"; consider how many people believe in astrology,\\ngraphology, and other pseudo-sciences.\\n\\nMany atheists feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe in\\ngods.  Certainly in many primitive human societies, religion allows the\\npeople to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understand.\\n\\nOf course, there\\'s more to religion than that.  In the industrialized world,\\nwe find people believing in religious explanations of phenomena even when\\nthere are perfectly adequate natural explanations.  Religion may have started\\nas a means of attempting to explain the world, but nowadays it serves other\\npurposes as well.\\n\\n\"But so many cultures have developed religions.  Surely that must say\\n something?\"\\n\\nNot really.  Most religions are only superficially similar; for example, it\\'s\\nworth remembering that religions such as Buddhism and Taoism lack any sort of\\nconcept of God in the Christian sense.\\n\\nOf course, most religions are quick to denounce competing religions, so it\\'s\\nrather odd to use one religion to try and justify another.\\n\\n\"What about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded\\n that God exists?\"\\n\\nFor every scientist or philosopher who believes in a god, there is one who\\ndoes not.  Besides, as has already been pointed out, the truth of a belief is\\nnot determined by how many people believe it.  Also, it is important to\\nrealize that atheists do not view famous scientists or philosophers in the\\nsame way that theists view their religious leaders.\\n\\nA famous scientist is only human; she may be an expert in some fields, but\\nwhen she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight.  Many\\nrespected scientists have made themselves look foolish by speaking on\\nsubjects which lie outside their fields of expertise.\\n\\n\"So are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates\\n nothing?\"\\n\\nNot entirely.  It certainly indicates that the religion in question has\\nproperties which have helped it so spread so far.\\n\\nThe theory of memetics talks of \"memes\" -- sets of ideas which can propagate\\nthemselves between human minds, by analogy with genes.  Some atheists view\\nreligions as sets of particularly successful parasitic memes, which spread by\\nencouraging their hosts to convert others.  Some memes avoid destruction by\\ndiscouraging believers from questioning doctrine, or by using peer pressure\\nto keep one-time believers from admitting that they were mistaken.  Some\\nreligious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled by\\nother memes.\\n\\nOf course, in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated with\\nsuccessful propagation of a meme.  Religion is not a good thing because of\\nthe number of people who believe it, any more than a disease is a good thing\\nbecause of the number of people who have caught it.\\n\\n\"Even if religion is not entirely true, at least it puts across important\\n messages.  What are the fundamental messages of atheism?\"\\n\\nThere are many important ideas atheists promote.  The following are just a\\nfew of them; don\\'t be surprised to see ideas which are also present in some\\nreligions.\\n\\n   There is more to moral behaviour than mindlessly following rules.\\n\\n   Be especially sceptical of positive claims.\\n\\n   If you want your life to have some sort of meaning, it\\'s up to you to\\n   find it.\\n\\n   Search for what is true, even if it makes you uncomfortable.\\n\\n   Make the most of your life, as it\\'s probably the only one you\\'ll have.\\n\\n   It\\'s no good relying on some external power to change you; you must change\\n   yourself.\\n\\n   Just because something\\'s popular doesn\\'t mean it\\'s good.\\n\\n   If you must assume something, assume something it\\'s easy to test.\\n\\n   Don\\'t believe things just because you want them to be true.\\n\\nand finally (and most importantly):\\n\\n   All beliefs should be open to question.\\n\\nThanks for taking the time to read this article.\\n\\n\\nmathew\\n\\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\\nVersion: 2.2\\n\\niQCVAgUBK8AjRXzXN+VrOblFAQFSbwP+MHePY4g7ge8Mo5wpsivX+kHYYxMErFAO\\n7ltVtMVTu66Nz6sBbPw9QkbjArbY/S2sZ9NF5htdii0R6SsEyPl0R6/9bV9okE/q\\nnihqnzXE8pGvLt7tlez4EoeHZjXLEFrdEyPVayT54yQqGb4HARbOEHDcrTe2atmP\\nq0Z4hSSPpAU=\\n=q2V5\\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\\n\\nFor information about PGP 2.2, send mail to pgpinfo@mantis.co.uk.\\nÿ\\n'),\n",

I mean, it was the\\nFinnish team they played and they were taking advantage of the ridiculous\\npenalties the Canadien ref called in the last period. The Germans got a\\nmatch penalty and a 10 minutes misconduct for practically nothing and\\nseconds after that the German goalie got two minutes for \"delay of game\"\\nfor a shot that was deflected and went into the crowd. The resulting 5:3\\nskating advantage lead to the deciding goal at a point, when the Germans\\nwere starting to come up strong.\\nI am also sick of the nationalism that is going on in German sports events.\\nIf you watch for example a tennis Davis Cup match the players are often not\\nable to play for minutes, because the crowd is so obnoxious. But I have to\\nadmit that this kind of nationalism is as strong or even stronger in most\\nother countries (you should go to the US and watch the way they present the\\nOlympics on television; or the soccer crowds in England; or the Finnish\\nspectators at nordic skiing events.....). I mean it makes me sick to see\\nall this nationalism all over the world and I would rather see the best\\nteam/player win and get cheared at. I do not mind if my favorite team\\nlooses to somebody that is better or plays more attractive and I have to\\nadmit that in most sports the German national site is not my favorite team\\nto watch (the German soccer team is boring to watch, for example).\\nBut, reading the above posting, I think that you are on the same level as\\nthese crowds you are criticizing. It is easy to talk of (nearly all)\\nGermans as Nazis and nationalists; thats the kind of propaganda that all\\nultraconservative people use against Germany. It is true that there is a\\ngreat danger of re-arising nationalism in Germany but from my experience\\nmost of the people (at least of the people that i know) also regard this as\\na big threat and are trying to demonstrate this attitude now. Why can\\'t we\\njust look at people as human beeings and not try to put them into drawers\\ncorresponding to their nationality (eg. all Russians are Communists; all\\nAmericans are Capitalists; all Germans are Nazis, all Fins are hanging\\naround beeing drunk on ferries...). \\nIn my opinion, your comment shows the narrowness of your mind and that you\\ndon\\'t seem to be different from the Nazis you are talking about.\\n\\nThomas\\n\\n\\n\"There\\'s no time to hate, barely time to wait\" (Jerry Garcia/Robert Hunter)\\n\\n       \\n'),\n",

How many VRAM SIMM slots are there?\\n\\nTwo.\\n\\n>     .   What rules (if any) must be followed in filling the slots (e.g in\\n>                 pairs, sizes must match, etc.)?\\n\\nBoth SIMM slots must be filled; putting a SIMM in only one slot does \\nnothing for you.\\n\\n>     .   How fast must they be?\\n\\n80 ns for the Q800 and C650, 100 ns for the C610.\\n\\n>     .   Is there any other relevant information?\\n\\nThere are certain VRAM chip manufacturers whose parts are not compatible \\nwith the Quadra and Centris video hardware.  Make sure that the source you \\nget them from guarantees compatiblity.  In general, if it works in a Q950,\\nit will work in a Q800.\\n\\n> Please don't reply unless you have the *correct* information.

I have just been informed of what I feel is\\none of the most important things that we could ever discuss -- The \\nout-and-out censorship of one of our fellow posters because some people\\ndon\\'t like what he says or thinks.\\n\\nWe have all seen the postings here by AJ Teel.  Although many of us have\\nnot agreed with their content, I\\'m sure most of us have been at least\\nsomewhat interested in them.  I, for one, am greatful to live (I thought)\\nin a country where people like Mr. Teel are allowed to say what they please.\\nIf I don\\'t wan\\'t to read it, I can just skip on by, or unsuscribe.  But,\\nunfortunately, some people cannot let others live and let live.  They feel\\nan overwhelming need to snuff out the little bastards.

J. Teel, Sui Juris\" (ajteel@dendrite.cs.Colorado.EDU)\\nFollowup-To: alt.conspiracy\\nDistribution: \\nOrganization: University of Colorado, Boulder\\nKeywords: NWO Ted Frank\\n\\nWell, well, well... Thanks to eck@panix.com (Mark Eckenwiler) and\\nthf2@kimbark.uchicago.edu (Ted Frank), my account is to be axed.\\nI guess that the information I am presenting is just toooo difficult\\nfor them to deal with. They (ONLY Ted and Mark) have complained to my\\nsysadmin some unknown number of times to get me off the net. (In his\\ndefense, Mark sent only one message and it was not THAT bad; it has\\nbeen posted in one of the newsgroups; However, it *was* not directed\\nat me as would be common practice and I am VERY good at responding\\nvia netmail...)\\n\\nWhile I disagree with Ted, I would not send mail to his sysadmin\\nto get him axed. Name-calling was not enough; jumping on every post\\nI made was not enough; ignoring specific points when they were not\\nwhat the desired picture was not enough; SIMPLY IGNORING ME IF I\\nAM SUCH A KOOK WAS NOT ENOUGH. Even now I do not wish to have him\\naxed, but I do wish to express my disgust about this. \"Argumentum\\nad silence-your-opponent-um\"?! I would have thought he would have\\nwanted me to stay around just to have someone to yell about and\\nseem sooo wise... (to himself, I think).\\n\\nThe issue that seems to be: \"Is the following an advertisement?\"\\nApparently, Ted and Mark think so...\\n\\n1) I Posted an article from around one year ago as it was taken \\n\\t*off the net* from last year. If reposting an article\\n\\tconstitutes posting an ad, then I am guilty. This post\\n\\tdid have a name and address and, yes, a price. If one\\n\\thad posted the address and subscription price of \"Newsweek\",\\n\\twould that be an ad? I get nothing from showing this stuff.\\n2) I Posted a list of documents showing examples of the kind of\\n\\t\"proof\" that was REQUESTED BY TED FRANK. He then complains\\n\\tto my sysadmin saying that I am advertising and, lo and\\n\\tbehold, \"poof\", there goes my account. This one had an\\n\\taddress in it! Oh, no! I Guess that means it is an ad!\\n\\nIf you value the alternative view I have been discussing, or VALUE\\nITS DISCUSSION even if you do not agree with it, I ask that you send\\na note saying as much to me to show to the sysadmin. They rarely get\\n\"Ya know, that user on your net was real helpful...\" or whatever; they\\nonly get \"I don\\'t like what that user is doing because...\".\\nPlease do not send the note to the sysadmin. I need to take it to them\\nin a manner that has at least a chance of getting through.\\n\\nIn my files here are hundreds of responses from people saying \"Thanks for\\nthe info\" or \"Could you send me such and such?\" or \"Your posts are\\nvery interesting... keep it up.\" and only a handfull of \"Go aways\". But,\\nI guess the fact that I have decided not to waste my time trying to\\nconvince Ted is a Net Offense[TM] of such magnitude as to warrant\\na message complaining about me. (Knock, knock...\"My name is Ted and\\nand this is Mark... We\\'re from the thought police. Seems you have\\nsome pretty dangerous ideas here, and we\\'re here to confiscate them...\")\\nNWO Indeed!\\n\\nGuess I will have to go back to the drawing board and come up with\\na new plan... Thanks Ted and Mike. Hope you are happy.\\nI will be on for a few more days and then... that\\'s all folks!\\nYour comments and support are requested. I can no longer post\\nto news. I ask what this has accomplished... Is there some benefit\\nfrom making alternative views simply vanish? Not in my book. \\nSeems the easiest way to win an argument is to make the opposing side\\nshut up. Images of Waco.... ah, but alas... And all this when I am in the\\nprocess of typing in a letter to me from the Tax Collector saying that\\na lien was removed due to a letter that I wrote challenging jurisdiction.\\nOh, well... It takes time to come up with the info requested, and I\\nwas just getting started.\\n\\nIt should be noted that Ted Frank has been accused publicly over 40\\ntimes of being an NWO supporter and has never made an statements to the\\ncontrary. Further, what ARE Ted Frank\\'s motivations for getting me axed?\\nWe all know that SOME PEOPLE are getting paid to collect info on people\\non the net that are of \"interest\" to the government, and Ted sure seems\\nto have a *personal* interest in debunking me. Hmmm... just who does\\nhe work for? The University of Chicago which he \"attends\"(?) is well\\nknown as one of the biggest NWO supporters...\\n\\nAnd finally, if anyone would be able to help me find a new account here\\nin the Boulder/Denver area, I would greatly appreciate it. I am in the\\nprocess of installing Linux and so will be able to do UUCP or maybe\\na TC/IP connection. Any help here would be greatly appreciated. Since I\\nam longer be able to post news and will no longer have email VERY\\nsoon, I hope that anyone who wishes to contact me will do so via:\\n\\n\\tA. J.

The 1986 Safe\\nDrinking Water Act requires all surface water systems to either\\nfilter their water or fully protect the rivers or lakes they use\\nfrom pollution,\" Olson continued.  Some systems are moving\\ntowards eventually implementing filtration systems but are\\nexpected to miss the law\\'s deadline.\\n   Olson pointed out that the threat of contamination is already\\na reality in other cities.  A 1991 survey of 66 U.S. surface\\nwater systems by water utility scientists found that 87 percent\\nof raw water samples contained the Milwaukee organism\\ncryptosporidium, and 81 percent contained a similar parasite\\ncalled giardia.\\n   Adding to the level of concern, a General Accounting Office\\nstudy released today by House Health and Environment Subcommittee\\nChairman Henry Waxman indicates serious deficiencies in the\\nnation\\'s system for conducting and following through on sanitary\\nsurveys of water systems.\\n   \"This new information raises a huge warning sign that millions\\nof Americans can no longer simply turn on their taps and be\\nassured that their water is safe to drink.  We must immediately\\nput into place programs to protect water sources from\\ncontamination and where this is not assured, filtration equipment\\nmust be installed to protect the public,\" Olson noted.  \"The time\\nhas come for many of the nation\\'s water utilities to stop\\ndragging their feet and to aggressively protect their water from\\ncontamination; consumers are prepared to pay the modest costs\\nneeded to assure their water is safe to drink.\"\\n   NRDC is a national non-profit environmental advocacy organization.\\n\\n   Systems EPA Indicates Require Filtration and Do Not Adequately\\nProtect Watersheds\\n\\n CONNECTICUT\\n\\n Bridgeport            Bridgeport Hydraulic Co.\\n\\n MASSACHUSETTS\\n Boston                H2O Resource Author (MWRA)\\n Medford               MWRA-Medford Water Dept\\n Melrose               MWRA-Melrose Water Dept\\n Hilton                MWRA-Hilton Water Dept\\n Needham               MWRA-Needham Water Division\\n Newtoncenter          MWRA-Newton Water Dept.\\n Marblehead            MWRA-Marblehead Water Dept\\n Quincy                MWRA-Quincy Water Dept\\n Norwood               MWRA-Norwood Water Dept\\n Framingham            MWRA-Framingham Water Div\\n Cambridge             MWRA-Cambridge Water Dept\\n Canton                MWRA-Canton Water Div-DPW\\n Chelsea               MWRA-Chelsea Water Dept\\n Everett               MWRA-Everett Water Dept\\n Lexington             MWRA-201 Bedford (PUO WRKS)\\n Lynn                  MWRA-Lynn Water & Sewer Co\\n Malden                MWRA-Malden Water Division\\n Revere                MWRA-Revere Water Dept\\n Woburn                MWRA-Woburn Water Dept\\n Swampscott            MWRA-Swampscott Water Dept\\n Saugus                MWRA-Saugus Water Dept\\n Somerville            MWRA-Somerville Water Dept\\n Stoneman              MWRA-Stoneman Water Dept\\n Brookline             MWRA-Brookline Water Dept\\n Wakefield             MWRA-Same as Above\\n Waltham               MWRA-Waltham Water Division\\n Watertown             MWRA-Watertown Water Division\\n Weston                MWRA-Weston Water Dept\\n Dedham                MWRA-Dedham-Westwood District\\n Winchester            MWRA-Winchester Water & Sewer\\n Winthrop              MWRA-Winthrop Water Dept\\n Boston                MWRA-Boston Water & Sewer Co\\n S.

I do actually quote some things\\nthat Roger Meynard wrote, but it might be better to think of this as\\n\"sampling\" his post (in the hip-hop sense) because it fits in with what\\nI want to say.\\n\\nmaynard@ramsey.cs.laurentian.ca (Roger Maynard) writes:\\n>But the point is that the only decision making pro-\\n>cess  used to determine the \"best\" is the score of the game and it re-\\n>lates to the *teams*.  Not the individual players.  There is no method\\n>inherent  in  baseball of comparing individual performances.  And that\\n>is how it should be, because, after all, baseball is a team game.\\n\\nThere\\'s an interesting parallel between this way of viewing a baseball\\nteam and some people\\'s conception of a biological organism.  In the\\nbiology context, we would very likely read \"fitness\" for \"the score of\\nthe game\" and \"organisms\" for \"teams\".  How we interpret \"players\" is\\ntrickier, but either \"organs\", or \"genes\" might seem reasonable\\nchoices depending on what point we were trying to make.  A \"genes\"\\ninterpretation actually might be really interesting in this case, \\nbut that would be a different and probably longer post.\\n\\nIf, however, we take the \"organ\" view, then our knowledge of biology\\nshould make us pause before we start saying things like \"species X is\\nmore fit than species Y because of a better organ Z\".  Given what we\\nknow about the interdependence of organs, we would often be suspicious\\nof such claims.  (But note that this type of argument is quite often\\nmade when you map \"species X\" onto \\'humans\\', and \"organ Z\" onto\\n\\'brain\\').  On the other hand, some statements of this kind do seem\\nmore reasonable than others, as far as we can test them (e.g. \\'brain\\'\\nabove might be more reasonable than \\'pancreas\\' assuming no gross\\npathology, particularly if species Y is a primate).\\n\\nEven when you make such statements, you should be concerned with the\\nfunctioning of the whole organism, and the possibility that one organ\\nmight be more crucial for one species and a second organ in another.\\n(Not to mention the possibility that no organ is particularly crucial\\nin some third species.)  However, if we are non-vitalists with any\\nkind of reductionsit streak, we will want to say that an organism is\\nnot some completely magical unanalyzable \"whole\" but an intriguing\\nprocess made up of various subprocesses that interact in ways that are\\npotentially observable.  Some of these processes might be localized to\\nparticular organs, while others may be distributed across multiple\\norgans.  In a way, this is just like a baseball team, except that I\\nthink it is pretty clear that the processes and interactions involved\\nin baseball are *much* simpler and less numerous than in most organisms.\\n\\n>To say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab-\\n>solutely  that  player A\\'s team would have played better with player B\\n>in their lineup.  Sheer speculation.  Impossible to ascertain.\\n\\nOne thing that is quite difficult about baseball is that perfectly\\ncontrolled experiments are sometimes very tough to do.  But, of\\ncourse, this has never stopped researchers from doing the best they\\ncan, and sometimes deriving very powerful conclusions even in the\\nabsence of certainty.  Most of this goes far beyond sheer speculation,\\nbut even sheer speculation can motivate further interesting research.\\n\\n>If you want to select a group of statistics and claim that Clemens\\n>has done better [than another pitcher] with those statistics as a\\n>criteria, then fine.\\n\\nIn this cases, we\\'re seeing the word \"statistics\" means \"summary of\\nobserved events\", where the events themselves can be viewed as the\\noutput of some process, and possibly inputs for other processes.\\nThus, if we have any valid notion of how the processes are put together\\ninto the functioning organism, data in the form of statistics might\\ngive us a basis to test particular hypotheses.\\n\\n>But you have to be able to prove that those statistics measure the\\n>individual\\'s contribution to winning the WS - because that is the only\\n>measure of \"best\" that has any meaning in the context of baseball.\\n\\nThis statement brings us back to the concept of fitness again.\\nFitness is defined in terms of both an organism and its environment;\\nyou might be fit in one situation and not another.  Moving to\\nbaseball, it is clear that each team spends the entire season in an\\nenvironment including all the other teams in the league.  In at least\\na nominal sense, the division winners are the fittest teams in the\\nleague, in that they (on average) had better fitness scores than any\\nof their competing opponennts.  But in a real sense, there is a fairly\\nlarge random component in the performance of each team that is\\ndifficult if not impossible to account for in terms of factors\\nintrinsic to (or interesting for) baseball.  The same is true in\\nbiology.  But here is also no direct biological equivalent of the\\nWorld Series in basebal.  In the world series, the random component\\nmay be greatly magnified by the small number of games that are played,\\nand both teams suddenly experience huge changes from the environement\\nwhere they were originally successful.  It might be fun to watch, but\\nit\\'s unclear what it all really means.\\n\\n***\\n\\nNow just one more un-related point:\\n\\n>I have yet to see that any of you can predict a\\n>WS winner with any greater accuracy than Jeanne Dixon.\\n\\nOn the other hand, you have seen some of us who can predict the\\noutcome of the divisional races better than a random assignment of\\nteams to finishes, and maybe some of us (e.g. me) who can do this\\nbetter than the other participants in this forum on a regular basis.\\nBut this is probably only due to the fact that a 162-game schedule\\ngives you a little hope that bad hops aren\\'t the only difference\\nbetween the winners and the losers.\\n\\nMoreover, you\\'ve had the opportunity to see some analysis of the World\\nSeries situation that makes the strong claim that *nobody* can predict\\nthe WS winner with reliably greater accuracy than a coin biased only\\nto reflect the well-known home vs. road effect on winning percentage.\\n\\n>The stats are a nice hobby and that\\'s about it.  There is no new\\n>knowledge being produced.  \\n\\nSince stats are summaries of events, it\\'s true that if you know the\\nevents you can derive the stats.  But if somebody is trying to\\nunderstand the process behind the stats, then the stats produce new\\nknowledge, and some of this might even be reliable, repeatable, and\\nuseful.  Speaking of which, I should get back to producing knowledge\\nin a different field.  That is, of course, if I can produce knowledge\\neven though I\\'m relying on stats to do it.\\n\\njking\\n\\n'),\n",

Noring has pointed out\\nthe catch-22 that if the \"crazy\" theory were true, you probably couldn\\'t\\nfind any direct evidence of it --- that you couldn\\'t observe those yeastie\\nbeasties with present methods even if they were there.  Noring and the\\nfellow from Oklahoma (sorry, forgot your name) have also suggested one set\\nof anecdotal evidence in favor based on their personal experiences ---\\nnamely, that when people with certain conditions are given anti-fungals,\\nmany of them appear to get better.  \\n\\nSo, if you have any evidence *against* the hypothesis --- for example,\\ncontrolled double-blind studies showing that the anti-fungals don\\'t do any\\nbetter than sugar water --- then let\\'s hear it.  If you don\\'t, then what we\\nhave is anecdotal and uncontrolled evidence on one side, and abject\\ndisbelief on the other.  In which case, please, there is no point in yelling\\nback and forth at each other any longer since neither side has any\\nconvincing evidence either positive or negative.  \\n\\nAnd I understand that your abject disbelief is based on the existence of\\npeople who may get famous or make money applying the diagnosis to everything\\nin sight, making wild claims with no evidence, and always refusing to do\\ncontrolled studies.  But that has absolutely no bearing on the apparently\\nsincere experiences of the people on the net observing anti-fungals working\\non themselves and other people in certain specific cases.  There are also\\nquacks who sell oral superoxide dismutase, in spite of the fact that it\\'s\\ncompletely broken down in the guts, but this doesn\\'t change the genuine\\nscientific knowledge about the role of superoxide dismutase in fighting\\noxidative damage.  Same thing.  Just cause there are candida quacks, that\\ndoesn\\'t establish evidence against the candida hypothesis.  If there\\'s some\\nother reason (besides the quacks), if only anecdotal, to think it could be\\ntrue, then that is what has to be considered, that is what the net people\\nhave been talking about.\\n\\nBut again, there is no point in arguing about it.  There is anecdotal\\nevidence, and there is no convincing evidence, and there are also some\\ncandida quacks out there, I hope everyone can agree on all of that.  Thus,\\nit appears to me the main question now is whether the proponents can\\nmarshall enough anecdotal evidence in a convincing and documented enough\\nmanner to make a good case for carrying out a good controlled double-blind\\nstudy of antifungals (or else, forget convincing anybody else to carry out\\nthe test, just carry it out themselves!) --- and also, whether they can\\nadequately define the patient population or symptoms on which such a study\\nshould be carried out to provide a fair test of the hypothesis.\\n\\nKen\\n-- \\n\\n'),\n",

No.  I have\\nnever heard contemporary prophets claim that what they receive from the\\nLord is on the same level as Scripture; on the contrary, those who are\\nmature obey the Scriptures by submitting their prophecies to fellow\\nbelievers for judgement.

Xt Glossary\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\no The Xt Intrinsics implement an object oriented interface to C code\\n  to allow useful graphical components to be created.  Included with\\n  this are classes that provide the base functionality: Object,\\n  RectObj, Core, Composite, Constraint, Shell, OverrideShell, WMShell,\\n  etc.  The terms \"Xt\" and \"Intrinsics\" are used interchangeably,\\n  however, they are used very precisely to mean a specific library of the X\\n  window system.  In particular, it does not include the Athena,\\n  Motif, OLIT or any other widget set.  Without further widgets the\\n  Intrinsics are not especially useful.\\n\\no A widget refers to a user interface abstraction created via Xt.  The\\n  precise use, is any object that is a subclass of the Core class.  It\\n  is used loosely to refer to anything that is a subclass of the\\n  Object class although these are more accurately called windowless\\n  widgets or gadgets.\\n\\no Xlib is the C interface to the X11 protocol.  It is one layer below\\n  the Xt Intrinsics.  Typically a widget uses relatively few Xlib\\n  functions because Xt provides most such services although an\\n  understanding of Xlib helps with problems.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n1.

Related FAQ\\'s\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nDavid B. Lewis (uunet!craft!faq) maintains the FAQ on X.  It\\nis posted monthly on comp.windows.x and located on export in contrib/FAQ.\\n\\nLiam R. E. Quin (lee@sq.sq.com) posts an FAQ list on Open Look to \\ncomp.windows.x.  \\n\\nJan Newmarch (jan@pandonia.canberra.edu.au) posts an FAQ list on Motif \\nto comp.windows.x.motif.\\n\\nPeter Ware (ware@cis.ohio-state.edu) posts an FAQ list for\\ncomp.windows.x.intrinsics; it is on export in contrib/FAQ-Xt.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n3.  Why does my application core dump when I use signals/alarms/cthreads?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIn brief, Xlib, Xt and most widget sets have no mutual exclusion for\\ncritical sections.  Any interrupt handler is likely to leave one of\\nthe above libraries in an inconsistent state -- such as all the\\nappropriate flags not yet set, dangling pointers, in the middle of a\\nlist traversal, etc.  Note that the ANSI C standard points out that\\nbehavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls\\nany function other than signal() itself, so this is not a problem\\nspecific to Xlib and Xt; the POSIX specification mentions other\\nfunctions which may be called safely but it may not be assumed that\\nthese functions are called by Xlib or Xt functions.\\n\\nThe only safe way to deal with signals is to set a flag in the\\ninterrupt handler.  This flag later needs to be checked either by a\\nwork procedure or a timeout callback.  It is incorrect to add either\\nof these in the interrupt handler.  As another note, it is dangerous\\nto add a work procedure that never finishes.  This effectively\\npreempts any work procedures previously added and so they will never\\nbe called.  Another option is to open a pipe, tell the event loop\\nabout the read end using XtAppAddInput() and then the signal handler\\ncan write a byte to the write end of the pipe for each signal.\\nHowever, this could deadlock your process if the pipe fills up.\\n\\nWhy don\\'t the Intrinsics deal with this problem?  Primarily because it\\nis supposed to be a portable layer to any hardware and operating\\nsystem.   Is that a good enough reason -- I don\\'t think so.\\n\\n        Note: the article in The X Journal 1:4 and the example in O\\'Reilly\\nVolume 6 are in error.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n4.  How do I use a different visual than the default?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThis requires a more complicated answer than it should.  A window has\\nthree things that are visual specific -- the visual, colormap and\\nborder pixmap.  All widgets have their own Colormap and BorderPixmap\\nresource; only shell widgets have Visual resources (another questions\\ndeals with why shells have a Visual).  The default value of these\\nresources is CopyFromParent which does exactly what it says.  In the\\nshell widget CopyFromParent gets evalulated as DefaultVisualOfScreen\\nand DefaultColormapOfScreen.  When any one of the three resources is\\nnot properly set, a BadMatch error occurs when the window is\\ncreated.  They are not properly set because each of the values depends\\non the visual being used.  \\n\\nHow to get this to work?  There are two parts to the answer.  The\\nfirst is if you want an application to start with a particular visual\\nand the second is if you want a particular shell within an application\\nto start with a different visual.

Which visual should an application use?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThis is a point that can be argued about but one opinion is there is\\nno way for an application to know the appropriate visual -- it has to\\nbe specified by the user.  If you disagree with this then your\\napplication probably falls into the category of always using the\\ndefault visual or it is hardware specific and expects some particular\\nvisual such as 24bit TrueColor with an OverlayPlane extension (or some\\nsuch).\\n\\nWhy?  No application runs in isolation.  Depending on the way a server\\nallocates resources I may not always want your application to run in\\nTrueColor mode if it is going to mess up my other applications.  I may\\nbe very upset if it chooses to run in GreyScale instead of PsuedoColor\\nor just monochrome.\\n\\nAs an example, on a low end color Sun server there are many different\\npossible visuals: monochrome, 256 entry colormap, static gray, static\\ncolor, and a 3/3/2 TrueColor.  The SGI Iris\\'s offer all the above \\nplus 12 bit TrueColor, 24 bit TrueColor, an Overlay Plane.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n6.  Why do only Shell widgets have a Visual?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThis is strictly by convention.  It makes it possible for an arbitrary\\nwidget to know that the visual it uses can be found by looking for the\\nshell widget that is its ancestor and obtaining the visual of that\\nshell.\\n\\nA widget can have its own visual resource.  If it does, it must have\\nits own realize method to use the visual when it calls\\nXCreateWindow().  You should also make this a resource that can be\\nobtained with XtGetValues() so other widgets can find it.  A\\nreasonable value is probably XtNvisual.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n7.  Which visual, depth and colormap do Shells inherit?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe default value for these resources are set to CopyFromParent.  This\\nis interpreted as the DefaultColormapOfScreen(), DefaultDepthOfScreen()\\nand the default visual of the screen if the widget has no parent -- i.e.\\nit is an applicationShellWidgetClass and the root of your widget tree.\\n\\nIf the parent of the widget is not null, then the shell copies\\ncolormap and depth from its parent and uses CopyFromParent as the\\nvisual.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n8.  I\\'ve done all the above and I still get a BadMatch error.  Why?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSome resource converters improperly cache references.  This was\\nespecially true of X11R3 and earlier versions of Motif.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n9.  Why doesn\\'t my widget get destroyed when I call XtDestroyWidget()?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSee section 2.8 of the Xt specification.\\n\\nIt eventually does get destroyed, just not immediately.  The\\nIntrinsics destroy a widget in a two-phase process.  First it and all\\nof its children have a flag set that indicate it is being destroyed.\\nIt is then put on a list of widgets to be destroyed.  This way any\\npending X events or further references to that widget can be cleaned\\nup before the memory is actually freed.  The second phase is then\\nperformed after all callbacks, event handlers, and actions have\\ncompleted, before checking for the next X event.  At this point the\\nlist is traversed and each widget\\'s memory is actually free()\\'d, among\\nother things.\\n\\nAs some further caveats/trivia, the widgets may be destroyed if the\\nIntrinsics determine that they have no further references to the\\nwidgets on the list.  If so, then the phase 2 destruction occurs\\nimmediately.  Also, if nested event loops are used, widgets placed on\\nthe destroy list before entering the inner event loop are not\\ndestroyed until returning to the outer event loop.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n10. How do I exit but still execute the DestroyCallbacks?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe problem is if a simple and entirely reasonable approach to exiting\\nan application is used, such as calling exit() directly, then a widget\\nmay not have a chance to clean up any external state -- such as open\\nsockets, temporary files, allocated X resources, etc.  (this code for\\nsimplicity reasons assumes only a single toplevel widget):\\n\\n\\n\\tWidget\\n\\tToplevelGet (gw)\\n\\t\\tWidget\\t\\tgw;\\t\\t/* widget to find toplevel */\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\tWidget\\t\\ttop;\\n\\n\\t\\tfor (top = gw; XtParent (top); top = XtParent (top))\\n\\t\\t\\t/* empty */;\\n\\t\\treturn (top);\\n\\t}\\n\\n\\tvoid\\n\\tExitCallback (gw, closure, call_data)\\n\\t\\tWidget\\t\\tgw;\\t\\t/* widget */\\n\\t\\tXtPointer\\tclosure;\\t/* data the app specified */\\n\\t\\tXtPointer\\tcall_data;\\t/* widget specific data */\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\tWidget\\t\\ttoplevel;\\n\\n\\t\\ttoplevel = ToplevelGet (gw);\\n\\t\\tXtUnmapWidget (toplevel);\\t/* make it disappear quickly */\\n\\t\\tXtDestroyWidget (toplevel);\\n\\t\\texit (0);\\n\\t}\\n\\nOne can see that the above code exit\\'s immediately after destroying\\nthe toplevel widget.  The trouble is the phase 2 destruction may never\\noccur.  \\n\\nThis works for most widgets and most applications but will not work\\nfor those widgets that have any external state.  You might think that\\nsince it works now it will always work but remember that part of the\\nreason an object oriented approach is used is so one can be ignorant\\nof the implementation details for each widget.  Which means that the\\nwidget may change and someday require that some external state is\\ncleaned up by the Destroy callbacks.\\n\\nOne alternative is to modify ExitCallback() to set a global flag and\\nthen test for that flag in a private event loop.  However, private\\nevent loops are frowned upon because it tends to encourage sloppy, and\\ndifficult to maintain practices.\\n\\nTry the following code instead.\\n\\n\\t#include <X11/Intrinsic.h>\\n\\n\\textern Widget ToplevelGet (\\n\\t#if NeedFunctionPrototypes\\n\\t\\tWidget\\t\\tgw\\n\\t#endif\\n\\t);\\n\\n\\textern Boolean ExitWorkProc (\\n\\t#if NeedFunctionPrototypes\\n\\t\\tXtPointer\\tclosure\\n\\t#endif\\n\\t);\\n\\n\\textern void ExitCallback (\\n\\t#if NeedFunctionPrototypes\\n\\t\\tWidget\\t\\tgw,\\n\\t\\tXtPointer\\tclosure,\\n\\t\\tXtPointer\\tcall_data\\n\\t#endif\\n\\t);\\n\\n\\tWidget\\n\\tToplevelGet (gw)\\n\\tWidget\\t\\tgw;\\t\\t/* widget to find toplevel */\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\tWidget\\t\\ttop;\\n\\n\\t\\tfor (top = gw; XtParent (top); top = XtParent (top))\\n\\t\\t\\t/* empty */;\\n\\t\\treturn (top);\\n\\t}\\n\\n\\n\\tvoid\\n\\tExitCallback (gw, closure, call_data)\\n\\tWidget\\t\\tgw;\\t\\t/* widget */\\n\\tXtPointer\\tclosure;\\t/* data the app specified */\\n\\tXtPointer\\tcall_data;\\t/* widget specific data */\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\tWidget\\t\\ttoplevel;\\n\\n\\t\\ttoplevel = ToplevelGet (gw);\\n\\t\\tXtUnmapWidget (toplevel);\\t/* make it disappear quickly */\\n\\t\\tXtDestroyWidget (toplevel);\\n\\t\\tXtAppAddWorkProc (XtWidgetToApplicationContext (gw),\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t  ExitWorkProc, (XtPointer) NULL);\\n\\t}\\n\\n\\tBoolean\\n\\tExitWorkProc (closure)\\n\\t\\tXtPointer\\tclosure;\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\texit (0);\\n\\t\\t/*NOTREACHED*/\\n\\t}\\n\\n\\nExitCallback() adds a work procedure that will get called when the\\napplication is next idle -- which happens after all the events are\\nprocessed and the destroy callbacks are executed.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n11. How do I resize a Shell widget?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAfter it is realized, one doesn\\'t resize a Shell widget.  The proper\\nthing is to resize the currently managed child of the Shell widget\\nusing XtSetValues().  The geometry change is then propagated to the\\nShell which asks the window manager which may or may not allow the\\nrequest.  However, the Shell must have the resource\\nXtNallowShellResize set to True otherwise it will not even ask the\\nwindow manager to grant the request and the Shell will not resize.\\n\\nTo change the position of a Shell, use XtSetValues() on the Shell, not\\nthe child, and within the limits of the window manager it should be granted.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n12. Why can\\'t XtAppAddInput() handle files?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIt does, however Unix semantics for when I/O is ready for a file does\\nnot fit most peoples\\' intuitive model.  In Unix terms a file\\ndescriptor is ready for reading whenever the read() call would not\\nblock, ignoring the setting of optional flags that indicate not to\\nblock.  This works as expected for terminals, sockets and pipes.  For\\na file the read() will always return but the return indicates an EOF\\n-- i.e. no more data.  The result is the code in the Intrinsics always\\ncalls the input handler because it always thinks something is about to\\nbe read.  The culprit is the select() system call or on SYSV based\\nOS\\'s it is the poll() system call.\\n\\nHow to get around this on a Unix system?  The best approach is to use\\nanother process to check for available input on the file.  Use a pipe\\nto connect the application with this other process and pass the file\\ndescriptor from the pipe to XtAppAddInput().  A suitable program on\\nBSD systems is \"tail -f filename\".\\n\\nIt\\'s rumored that select() on some systems is not _completely_\\nreliable.  In particular:\\n\\n\\t- IBM AIX 3.1: this is one where it would work for a while\\n\\t  (several thousand times) and then stop until some other\\n\\t  event woke it up. This seemed to be the result of a race\\n\\t  condition in the Kernel.  IBM claims to have a fix for this.\\n\\n\\t- Pyramid, doesn\\'t work at all.\\n\\n\\t- Ultrix (and possibly others where pipes are implemented as\\n\\t  sockets), wasn\\'t completely broken, but although the writing\\n\\t  side wrote in 512 byte blocks the reading side received it\\n\\t  all broken up as if it was being put into the pipe a byte at\\n\\t  a time.  You can waste a lot of time by reading small blocks\\n\\t  (get raound it by detecting the situation and having\\n\\t  select() ignore the pipe for 10 mseconds - by then it had\\n\\t  been given the whole block).\\n\\n\\nNote that all the above descriptions used Unix terminology such as\\nread(), file descriptor, pipes, etc.  This is an OS dependent area and\\nmay not be identical on all systems.  However the Intrinsic designers\\nfelt it was a common enough operation that it should be included with\\npart of the toolkit.  Why they didn\\'t also deal with signals at this\\npoint I don\\'t know.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n13. What good books and magazines are there on Xt?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nI have a favorite that is the definitive reference.

Keep\\nyour eyes open and expect some change about the same time a language\\nother than C _starts_ gaining acceptance.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n16. How do I pass a float value to XtSetValues?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nFirst, what is going wrong is the structure for an Arg is (essentially)\\n\\ttypdef struct\\n\\t{\\t\\n\\t    String\\tname;\\n\\t    long\\tvalue;\\n\\t} Arg;\\n\\nand the code:\\n\\tArg\\targ;\\n\\n\\tXtSetArg (arg, \"name\", 3.2)\\n\\nexpands to\\n\\tArg\\targ;\\n\\n\\targ.name = \"name\";\\n\\targ.value = 3.2;\\n\\nyou can see that with normal C type conversions, the arg.value\\ngets the integer \"3\" instead of the floating point value \"3.2\".  When\\nthe value is copied into the widget resource, the bit pattern is\\nwildly different than that required for a floating point value.  So,\\nhow to get around this?\\n\\nThe following macro is from the Athena widgets document and I am now\\nrecomending it over the previous suggestions.\\n\\n#define XtSetFloatArg(arg, n, d) \\\\\\n    if (sizeof(float) > sizeof(XtArgVal)) { \\\\\\n        XtSetArg(arg, n, &(d)); \\\\\\n    } else { \\\\\\n        XtArgVal *ld = (XtArgVal *)&(d); \\\\\\n        XtSetArg(arg, n, *ld); \\\\\\n    }\\n\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n17. How do I write a resource converter?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nCourtesy of Rich Thomson (rthomson@dsd.es.com):\\n\\nThe following discussion of resource converters assumes R4 (or R5)\\nIntrinsics.  Resource converters changed between R3 and R4 to allow\\nfor destructors and caching of converted values.\\n\\nThere are several main types of resource converters:\\n\\n    string to data type\\n    data type to string\\n    data type to data type\\n\\ni) string to data type\\n    Usually a string to data type converter has a fixed set of strings\\n    that will be converted to data type values.  This is most often\\n    used to map enumerated names to enumerated values:\\n\\n\\tName\\t\\tValue\\n\\t\"True\"\\t\\t1\\n\\t\"False\"\\t\\t0\\n\\n    In this case, the string to data type converter needs to compare\\n    the resource value to the list of fixed strings.  This is most\\n    readily accomplished by the use of the \"quark\" mechanism of the\\n    resource manager.  The resource value is turned into a quark,\\n    which is a unique representation of the string that fits into a\\n    single word.  Then the resource quark is compared against the\\n    quarks for the fixed strings representing the enumerated values.\\n\\n    If there are many enumerated strings in the converter (or many\\n    converters, each with a small number of enumeration strings), then\\n    a global initialization routine might be used to turn all the\\n    resource strings into quarks.  That way, the first time one of\\n    these converters is used, the strings will be turned into quarks\\n    and held in static variables for use in the next invocation of one\\n    of the converters.\\n\\nii) data type to string\\n    This type of converter is slightly easier than the string to data\\n    type converters since the use of quarks isn\\'t necessary.  Instead,\\n    the data type value is simply converted to a string value,\\n    probably by the use of sprintf.\\n\\n    Data type to string converters are useful for applications that\\n    wish to convert an internal data type value into a string so that\\n    they can write out a valid resource specification to a file.  This\\n    mechanism can be used to provide a \"snapshot\" of application state\\n    into a file.  This snapshot can be used to restore the program to\\n    a known state via the usual X resource database mechanisms.\\n\\n    If you are taking the trouble to write a string to data type\\n    converter, it isn\\'t much extra effort to write the data type to\\n    string converter.  Writing both at the same time helps to ensure\\n    that they are consistent.\\n\\niii) data type to data type\\n    This type of converter is used to convert an existing data type\\n    value to another data type.  For instance, an X pixel value can be\\n    converted to an RGB data type that contains separate fields for\\n    red, green and blue.\\n\\n\\nThe type signature for a resource converter is as follows:\\n\\ntypedef Boolean (*XtTypeConverter)(Display *, XrmValuePtr, Cardinal *,\\n\\tXrmValuePtr, XrmValuePtr, XtPointer *);\\n    Display *dpy;\\n    XrmValuePtr args;\\n    Cardinal *num_args;\\n    XrmValuePtr fromVal;\\n    XrmValuePtr toVal;\\n    XtPointer *converter_data;\\n\\nWhen the converter is invoked, the \"fromVal\" argument points to the source\\nX resource manager value and the \"toVal\" argument points to the\\ndestination X resource manager value.  The \"converter_data\" argument\\nis an opaque pointer to some converter-specific data that is specified\\nwhen the converter is registered.  The \"args\" and \"num_args\" arguments\\nallow extra information to be passed to the converter when it is\\ninvoked.  For instance, the Pixel to RGB structure converter discussed\\nabove would need colormap and visual arguments in which to lookup the\\nPixel to obtain the RGB values corresponding to that pixel.\\n\\nCare must be taken with the \"toVal\" argument.  An XrmValue has the\\nfollowing type definition and specifies a size and location for a\\nconverted value:\\n\\ntypedef struct {\\n    unsigned int    size;\\n    caddr_t         addr;\\n} XrmValue, *XrmValuePtr;\\n\\nWhen the converter is invoked, the address may point to a location of\\nthe given size for the converted value or the location can be NULL.\\nIn the former case, the converter should ensure that the size of the\\ndestination area is large enough to handle the converted value.  If\\nthe destination area is not large enough, then the converter should\\nset the size to the amount of space needed and return False.  The\\ncaller can then ensure that enough space is allocated and reinvoke the\\nconverter.  If the size is large enough, then the converter can simply\\ncopy the converted value into the space given and return True.\\n\\nIf the location is NULL, then the converter can assign the location to\\nthe address of a static variable containing the converted value and\\nreturn True.\\n\\nWhen writing a group of converters, this code is often repeated and it\\nbecomes convenient to define a macro:\\n\\n    #define DONE(var, type) \\\\\\n      if (toVal->addr) \\\\\\n\\t{ \\\\\\n\\t  if (toVal->size < sizeof(type)) \\\\\\n\\t    { \\\\\\n\\t      toVal->size = sizeof(type); \\\\\\n\\t      return False; \\\\\\n\\t    } \\\\\\n\\t  else \\\\\\n\\t    *((type *) toVal->addr) = var; \\\\\\n\\t} \\\\\\n      else \\\\\\n\\ttoVal->addr = (caddr_t) &var; \\\\\\n      toVal->size = sizeof(type); \\\\\\n      return True;\\n\\n    #define DONESTR(str) \\\\\\n      if (toVal->addr && toVal->size < sizeof(String)) \\\\\\n\\t{ \\\\\\n\\t  toVal->size = sizeof(String); \\\\\\n\\t  return False; \\\\\\n\\t} \\\\\\n      else \\\\\\n\\ttoVal->addr = (caddr_t) str; \\\\\\n      toVal->size = sizeof(String); \\\\\\n      return True;\\n\\nInside the converter, it is a good idea to perform a little safety\\nchecking on the \"num_args\" and \"args\" arguments to ensure that your\\nconverter is being called properly.\\n\\nOnce you have written your converter, you need to register it with the\\nIntrinsics.  The Intrinsics invokes resource converters when creating\\nwidgets and fetching their resource values from the resource database.\\n\\nTo register a converter with a single application context, use\\nXtAppSetTypeConverter:\\n\\nvoid XtAppSetTypeConverter(context, from, to, converter, args, num_args,\\n\\tcache, destructor)\\n    XtAppContext context;\\n    String from;\\n    String to;\\n    XtTypeConverter converter;\\n    XtConvertArgList args;\\n    Cardinal num_args;\\n    XtCacheType cache;\\n    XtDestructor destructor;\\n\\nTo register a converter with all application contexts, use\\nXtSetTypeConverter:\\n\\nvoid XtSetTypeConverter(from, to, converter, args, num_args,\\n\\tcache, destructor)\\n    String from;\\n    String to;\\n    XtTypeConverter converter;\\n    XtConvertArgList args;\\n    Cardinal num_args;\\n    XtCacheType cache;\\n    XtDestructor destructor;\\n\\nIn the R3 Intrinsics, there were the routines XtAppAddConverter and\\nXtAddConverter; these have been superseded by XtAppSetTypeConverter\\nand XtSetTypeConverter.  Whenever possible, the newer routines should be\\nused.\\n\\nWhen a converter is registered with the Intrinsics, a \"cache\" argument\\nspecifies how converted resource values are to be cached:\\n\\n    XtCacheNone\\t\\tDon\\'t cache any converted values\\n    XtCacheAll\\t\\tCache all converted values\\n    XtCacheByDisplay\\tCache converted values on a per display basis\\n\\nCaching converted values that require a round-trip to the server is a\\ngood idea (for instance string to Pixel conversions).\\n\\nThe \"destructor\" argument is a routine that is invoked then the\\nresource is destroyed, either because its cached reference count has\\nbeen decremented to zero or because the widget owning the value is\\nbeing destroyed.  XtDestructor has the following type definition:\\n\\ntypedef void (*XtDestructor)(XtAppContext, XrmValuePtr, XtPointer,\\n\\tXrmValuePtr, Cardinal *);\\n    XtAppContext context;\\n    XrmValuePtr to;\\n    XtPointer converter_data;\\n    XrmValuePtr args;\\n    Cardinal *num_args;\\n\\nThe destructor is invoked to free any auxiliary storage associated\\nwith the \"to\" argument, but does not actually free the storage pointed\\nto by the \"to\" argument itself (to->addr).  The destructor is passed\\nthe extra arguments that were passed to the converter when the\\nconversion was performed (for instance, colormap and visual arguments\\nfor the string to Pixel converter since the destructor would need to\\nfree the allocated Pixel from the colormap) as well as the private\\ndata passed in when the converter was registered.\\n\\nSample converter code can be found in the following files in the MIT\\nR5 distribution:\\n\\n    mit/lib/Xt/Converters.c\\n    contrib/lib/PEXt/Converters.c\\n    contrib/lib/PEXt/Converters.h\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n18. How do I open multiple displays?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSee \"Multi-user Application Software Using Xt\", The X Resource, Issue 3,\\n(Summer 1992) by Oliver Jones for a complete coverage of the issues\\ninvolved.  Most of this answer is based on that article.  In a\\nnutshell, one uses XtOpenDisplay() to add each display to a _single_\\napplication context and then XtCloseDisplay() to shutdown each display\\nand remove it from the application context.\\n\\nThe real problems occur when trying to close down a display.  This can\\nhappen 3 ways:\\n\\t1. User selects a \"quit\" button on one of the displays,\\n\\t2. User has window manager send a WM_DELETE_WINDOW message,\\n\\t3. Server disconnect -- possibly from a KillClient message,\\n\\t   server shutdown/crash, or network failure.\\n\\nI\\'ll assume you can deal gracefully with 1 & 2 since it is _merely_ a\\nproblem of translating a Widget to a display and removing that\\ndisplay.  If not, then read the Oliver Jones article.\\n\\nThe third one is difficult to handle.  The following is based on the\\nOliver Jones article and I include it here because it is a difficult\\nproblem.\\n\\nThe difficulty arises because the Xlib design presumed that an I/O\\nerror is always unrecoverable and so fatal.  This is essentially true\\nfor a single display X based application, but not true for a\\nmultiple display program or an application that does things other than\\ndisplay information on an X server.  When an X I/O error occurs the\\nI/O error handler is called and _if_ it returns then an exit()\\nhappens.  The only way around this is to use setjmp/longjmp to avoid\\nreturning to the I/O error handler.  The following code fragment\\ndemonstrates this:\\n\\n#include <setjmp.h>\\njmp_buf XIOrecover;\\n\\nvoid\\nXIOHandler (dpy)\\n\\tDisplay\\t\\t*dpy;\\n{\\n\\tdestroyDisplay (dpy);\\n\\tlongjmp (XIOrecover, 1);\\n}\\n\\nmain ()\\n{\\n\\t...\\n\\tif (setjmp (XIOrecover) == 0)\\n\\t\\tXSetIOErrorHandler (XIOHandler);\\n\\tXtAppMainLoop (app_context);\\n}\\n\\nThe destroyDisplay() is something that given a Display pointer can go\\nback to the application specific data and perform any necessary\\ncleanup.  It should also call XtCloseDisplay().\\n\\nFor those of you unfamiliar with setjmp/longjmp, when setjmp() is\\nfirst called it returns a 0 and save\\'s enough information in the\\njmp_buf that a latter execution of longjmp() can return the program to\\nthe same state as if the setjmp() was just executed.  The return value\\nof this second setjmp() is the value of the second argument to\\nlongjmp().  There are several caveats about using these but for this\\npurpose it is adequate.\\n\\nSome other problems you might run into are resource converters that\\nimproperly cache resources.  The most likely symptoms are Xlib errors\\nsuch as BadColor, BadAtom, or BadFont.  There may be problems with the\\ntotal number of displays you can open since typically only a limited\\nnumber of file descriptors are available with 32 being a typical\\nvalue.  You may also run into authorization problems when trying to\\nconnect to a display.\\n\\nThere was much discussion in comp.windows.x about this topic in\\nNovember of 91.  Robert Scheifler posted an article which basically\\nsaid this is the way it will be and Xlib will not change.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n19.

Where are the resources loaded from?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe resources of a widget are filled in from the following places\\n(from highest priority to lowest priority):\\n\\n\\t1. Args passed at creation time.\\n\\t2. Command line arguments.\\n\\t3. User\\'s per host defaults file\\n\\t4. User\\'s defaults file.\\n\\t5. User\\'s per application default file.\\n\\t6. System wide per application default file.\\n\\nNote that 2-6 are read only once on application startup.  The result\\nof steps 3-6 is a single resource database used for further queries.\\n\\nThe per host defaults file contains customizations for all\\napplications executing on a specific computer.  This file is either\\nspecified with the XENVIRONMENT environment variable or if that is not\\nset then the file $HOME/.Xdefaults-<host> is used.\\n\\nThe user defaults file is either obtained from the RESOURCE_MANAGER\\nproperty on the root window of the display or if that is not set then\\nthe file $HOME/.Xdefaults is used.  Typically, the program \"xrdb\" is\\nused to set the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.  Please note that this\\nshould be kept relatively small as each client that connects to the\\ndisplay must transfer the property.  A size of around 1-3KByte is\\nreasonable.  Some toolkits may track changes to the RESOURCE_MANAGER\\nbut most do not.\\n\\nA user may have many per application default files containing\\ncustomizations specific to each application.  The intrinsics are quite\\nflexible on how this file is found.  Read the next part that describes\\nthe various environment variables and how they effect where this file\\nis found.\\n\\nThe system wide per application default files are typically found in\\n/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults.  If such a file is not found then the\\nfallback resources are used.  The intrinsics are quite flexible on how\\nthis file is found.  Read the next part that describes the various\\nenvironment variables and how they effect where this file is found.\\n\\n[Thanks to Oliver Jones (oj@pictel.com) for the following, 6/92]\\n\\nYou can use several environment variables to control how resources are\\nloaded for your Xt-based programs -- XFILESEARCHPATH,\\nXUSERFILESEARCHPATH, and XAPPLRESDIR.  These environment variables\\ncontrol where Xt looks for application-defaults files as an\\napplication is initializing.  Xt loads at most one app-defaults file\\nfrom the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another from the path\\ndefined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH.\\n\\nSet XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such a\\nway that app-defaults files appear in several different directory\\nhierarchies.  Suppose, for example, that you are running Sun\\'s Open\\nWindows, and you also have some R4 X applications installed in\\n/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults. You could set a value like this for\\nXFILESEARCHPATH, and it would cause Xt to look up app-defaults files\\nin both /usr/lib/X11 and /usr/openwin/lib (or wherever your\\nOPENWINHOME is located):\\n\\n\\tsetenv XFILESEARCHPATH /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N:$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N\\n\\nThe value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list of\\npathnames.  The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows\\n(see XtResolvePathname()):\\n\\n\\t%N\\tThe value of the filename parameter, or the\\n\\t\\tapplication\\'s class name.\\n\\t%T\\tThe value of the file \"type\".  In this case, the\\n\\t\\tliteral string \"app-defaults\"\\n\\t%C\\tcustomization resource (R5 only)\\n\\t%S\\tSuffix.  None for app-defaults.\\n\\t%L\\tLanguage, locale, and codeset (e.g. \"ja_JP.EUC\")\\n\\t%l\\tLanguage part of %L  (e.g. \"ja\")\\n\\t%t\\tThe territory part of the display\\'s language string\\n\\t%c\\tThe codeset part of the display\\'s language string\\n\\nLet\\'s take apart the example.  Suppose the application\\'s class name is\\n\"Myterm\". Also, suppose Open Windows is installed in /usr/openwin.\\n(Notice the example omits locale-specific lookup.)\\n\\n\\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N        means /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm\\n\\t$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N    means /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/Myterm\\n\\nAs the application initializes, Xt tries to open both of the above\\napp-defaults files, in the order shown.  As soon as it finds one, it\\nreads it and uses it, and stops looking for others.  The effect of\\nthis path is to search first in /usr/lib/X11, then in /usr/openwin.\\n\\nLet\\'s consider another example. This time, let\\'s set\\nXUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Myterm.ad in the current\\nworking directory, then for Myterm in the directory ~/app-defaults.\\n\\n\\tsetenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH ./%N.ad:$HOME/app-defaults/%N\\n\\nThe first path in the list expands to ./Myterm.ad.  The second expands\\nto $HOME/app-defaults/Myterm.  This is a convenient setting for\\ndebugging because it follows the Imake convention of naming the\\napp-defaults file Myterm.ad in the application\\'s source directory, so\\nyou can run the application from the directory in which you are\\nworking and still have the resources loaded properly.\\n\\nNOTE: when looking for app-default files with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH,\\n      for some  bizarre reason, neither the type nor file suffix is\\n      defined so %T and %S are useless.\\n\\nWith R5, there\\'s another twist.  You may specify a customization\\nresource value.  For example, you might run the \"myterm\" application\\nlike this:\\n\\n\\tmyterm -xrm \"*customization: -color\"\\n\\nIf one of your pathname specifications had the value\\n\"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/%N%C\" then the expanded pathname would be\\n\"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm-color\" because the %C substitution\\ncharacter takes on the value of the customization resource.\\n\\nThe default XFILESEARCHPATH, compiled into Xt, is:\\n\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C:\\\\     (R5)\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N:\\\\\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N:\\\\\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N\\n\\n(Note: some sites replace /usr/lib/X11 with a ProjectRoot in this\\nbatch of default settings.)\\n\\nThe default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, also compiled into Xt, is \\n\\n\\t\\t<root>/%L/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)\\n\\t\\t<root>/%l/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)\\n\\t\\t<root>/%N%C:\\\\     (R5)\\n\\t\\t<root>/%L/%N:\\\\\\n\\t\\t<root>/%l/%N:\\\\\\n\\t\\t<root>/%N:\\n\\n<root> is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the user\\'s home directory\\nif XAPPLRESDIR is not set.  If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to some\\nvalue other than the default, Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether.\\n\\nNotice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find\\nyour app-defaults file in your current working directory is to set\\nXAPPLRESDIR to \".\", a single dot.  In R3, all this machinery worked\\ndifferently; for R3 compatibilty, many people set their XAPPLRESDIR\\nvalue to \"./\", a dot followed by a slash.\\n\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n21. What order are callbacks executed in?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n(Courtesy of Donna Converse, converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu; 5/10/92)\\n\\nThe Intrinsics library do not guarantee an order.  This is because\\nboth the widget writer and the application writer have the ability to\\nmodify the entire contents of the callback list.  Neither one\\ncurrently knows what the other is doing and so the Intrinsics cannot\\nguarantee the order of execution.\\n\\nThe application programmer cannot rely on the widget writer; the\\nwidget writer is not required to document when the widget will add and\\nremove callbacks from the list or what effect this will have;\\ntherefore the functionality contained in a callback should be\\nindependent of the functionality contained in other callbacks on the\\nlist.\\n\\nEven though the Xt standard in the definition of XtAddCallback\\nsays:\\n\\n \\t\"callback_name: Specifies the callback list to which the\\n \\tprocedure is to be appended.\"\\n \\nyou may not infer from the word \"appended\" that the callback routines\\nare called in the same order as they have been added to the callback\\nlist.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n22. How do I know if a widget is visible?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n(Courtesy of Donna Converse, converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu; 5/14/92)\\n\\n> I am building a widget needs to know if it is visible. I set the visible\\n> interest field in Core and if my window is completely obscured, the Core\\n> visible flag goes FALSE. However, if my window is iconified, the flag\\n> stays set to TRUE.\\n\\nRight, everything is implemented correctly.  This demonstrates a \"deficiency\"\\nin the X protocol, and the Core widget is reflecting the capabilities of the\\nprotocol.  (The \"deficiency\" is that the information is available in one way,\\nin this case an inconvenient way.)  The Xt specification is accurate, in\\nthe second and third paragraphs of section 7.10.2, so read this section\\ncarefully.  The visible field will not change in response to iconification.\\n\\nA VisibilityNotify event will not be received when the window goes from\\nviewable to unviewable, that is, when the widget or an ancestor is unmapped;\\nthat is, when iconification occurs.  This is the protocol deficiency.\\nVisibility state and viewable state have specific meanings in the X protocol;\\nsee the glossary in your Xlib and X protocol reference manual.\\n\\n> Is this a problem with \"mwm\" or is there something\\n> else which needs to be done?\\n\\nYou\\'ll see this with any window manager, with no window manager.\\n\\n> If the problem is \"mwm\", what is the fastest\\n> way to determine if a window is iconified? \\n\\nAs an application writer, keep track with a global Boolean in an action\\nroutine with translations for MapNotify and UnmapNotify on the Shell widget\\nwhich contains your custom widget.  As the custom widget writer, see the\\nmap_state field returned by a call to XGetWindowAttributes.  These are\\nsuggestions.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n23. How do I reparent a widget in Xt, i.e. XtReparentWidget()?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYou can\\'t.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n24. Why use XtMalloc, XtFree, etc?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nUnfortunately, most code that calls malloc(), realloc() or calloc()\\ntends to ignore the possibility of returning NULL.  At best it is\\nhandled something like:\\n\\n\\tptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type))\\n\\tif (!ptr)\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\tperror (\"malloc in xyzzy()\");\\n\\t\\texit (1)\\n\\t}\\nTo handle this common case the Intrinsics define the functions\\nXtMalloc(), XtCalloc(), XtNew(), XtNewString() and XtRealloc() which\\nall use the standard C language functions malloc(), calloc() and\\nrealloc() but execute XtErrorMsg() if a NULL value is returned.  Xt\\nerror handlers are not supposed to return so this effectively exits.\\n\\nIn addition, if XtRealloc() is called with a NULL pointer, it uses\\nXtMalloc() to get the initial space.  This allows code like:\\n\\n\\tif (!ptr)\\n\\t\\tptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type));\\n\\telse\\n\\t\\tptr = (type *) realloc (ptr, sizeof (type) * (count + 1));\\n\\t++count;\\n\\nto be written as:\\n\\n\\tptr = XtRealloc (ptr, sizeof (ptr) * ++count);\\n\\nAlso, XtFree() accepts a NULL pointer as an argument.  Generally, I\\'ve\\nfound the Xt functions conveniant to use.  However, anytime I\\'m\\nallocating anything potentially large I use the standard functions so\\nI can fully recover from not enough memory errors.\\n\\nXtNew() and XtNewString() are conveniant macros for allocating a\\nstructure or copying a string:\\n\\n\\t  struct abc *xyzzy;\\n\\t  char\\t     *ptr;\\n\\t  char\\t     *str = \"abcdef\";\\n\\n\\t  xyzzy = XtNew (struct abc);\\t/* takes care of type casting */\\n\\t  ptr = XtNewString (str);\\n\\nA strict interpretation of the Intrinsics reference manual allow an\\nimplementation to provide functions that are not exchangable with\\nmalloc() and free().  I.e. code such as:\\n\\n\\t char\\t      *ptr;\\n\\n\\t ptr = XtMalloc (100);\\n\\t /* ... */\\n\\t free (ptr);\\n\\nmay not work.  Personally, I\\'d call any implementation that did this\\nbroken and complain to the vendor.\\n\\nA common error for Motif programmers is to use XtFree() on a string\\nwhen they should really be using XmStringFree().\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n25. How to debug an Xt application?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nFirst, I\\'d recomend getting \"purify\" from Pure Software.  This is a\\ngreat package for tracing memory problems on Sun\\'s.  It\\'s a bit pricey\\nat $2750 but I\\'d still recomend it.  Excuse the marketing blurb\\n(contact support@pure.com for more info).\\n\\n\\tPurify inserts additional checking instructions directly into\\n\\tthe object code produced by existing compilers.  These\\n\\tinstructions check every memory read and write performed by\\n\\tthe program under test and detect several types of access\\n\\terrors, such as reading unitialized memory, writing past\\n\\tmalloc\\'d bounds, or writing to freed memory.  Purify inserts\\n\\tchecking logic into all of the code in a program, including\\n\\tthird party and vendor object-code libraries, and verifies\\n\\tsystem call interfaces.  In addition, Purify tracks memory\\n\\tusage and identifies individual memory leaks using a novel\\n\\tadaption of garbage collection techniques.  Purify\\'s nearly\\n\\tcomprehensive memory access checking slows the target program\\n\\tdown typically by a factor of two to five.\\n\\nAn alternative package that isn\\'t as pricey ($395 for a Sun), runs on\\nmany Unix\\'s and has pretty similar features is \"The SENTINEL Debugging\\nEnvironment\".  This replaces malloc() and several other C library\\nfunctions to add additional checks.  (contact cpcahil@virtech.vti.com\\nfor more info)\\n\\nNext, if you are getting any sort of Xlib error, you\\'ll need to run in\\nsynchronous mode, easily accomplished with the \"-sync\" command line\\nargument or by setting the variable Xdebug to 1 with your debugger.  Then\\nset a break point in exit().  This will let you trace back to the\\noriginal Xlib function being called.  If you don\\'t run in synchronous\\nmode, then the actual error may have occured any number of calls to\\nXlib previously since the Xlib calls are buffered and replies from the\\nserver are asynchronous.\\n\\nNext, if you are having trouble with window layout, you can use the\\nundocumented resource \"xtIdentifyWindows\" or the class resource\\n\"XtDebug\" to cause the widget name to be identified with each window.\\nFor example:\\n\\n    example% xload -xrm \\'*XtDebug:true\\' &\\n    example% xwininfo -tree\\n\\t     <click in new xload window>\\n\\nwill give the normal information but the widget name and class of each\\nwindow is included.  This can help for checking the location and size\\nof errant widgets.\\n\\nNext, if you are having trouble with geometry managers or you want to\\ntest the way a widget manages it\\'s children, you can try\\nexport.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/libXtGeo.tar.Z.  This acts as a filter\\nbetween any children and a geometry manager and checks the behaviour\\nof both.  It\\'s a very clever idea.\\n\\nThe most unfortunate problem is debugging a callback while the\\napplication is executing a grab of the keyboard or mouse (such as from\\na pulldown menu).  The server effectively locks up and you\\'ll need to\\ngo to another machine and kill the debugger manually.  The server\\nlocks up because the application being debugged has said no one else\\ncan have access to the keyboard but the application is not stopped\\nwaiting because the debugger is waiting for your commands.\\nUnfortunately you can\\'t give them because all the input is going to\\nyour application which is stopped.\\n\\nThe best way to debug this kind of problem is with two machines on\\nyour desk, running the program under a debugger (or other environment)\\non one machine, and running the application on the other, possibly\\nusing a command sequence like this:\\n\\n\\tothermachine% xhost +thismachine\\n\\tthismachine% setenv DISPLAY othermachine:0;\\n\\tthismachine% gdb application\\t# Your favorite debugger.\\n\\tor this:\\n\\tothermachine% xhost +thismachine\\n\\tthismachine% gdb application\\n\\t(gdb) set environment DISPLAY othermachine:0\\n\\t(gdb) run ...\\n\\nI believe CodeCenter, a C interpreter/graphical debugger has a method\\nof dealing with this by explicitely calling the Xlib functions to\\nrelease any grabs during breakpoints.\\n\\nDebugging widget problems requires pretty good debugging skills and\\nknowledge of how widgets work.  You can go a long way without knowing\\nthe internals of a particular widget but not very far without\\nunderstanding how a widget works.  Judicious use of conditional\\nbreakpoints and adding print statements with the debugger help a great\\ndeal.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n26. Why don\\'t XtAddInput(), XtAddTimeout() and XtAddWorkProc() work?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n   I have got a delicate problem with the three routines XtAddInput,\\n   XtAddTimeOut and XtAddWorkProc. The problem I have is that when\\n   I use them in my application they seem not to be registred properly.\\n   I have made a handy little testprogram where everything works\\n   perfect, but in my \"real\" application nothing happens. \\n\\nThe introduction in R3 of the XtApp*() functions obsoleted those\\nroutines (see Q19 for other changes in R3, R4, and R5).  What happens is\\nthey use a default application context different then the one you may\\nhave created.  Since events and timeouts are distributed on a per\\napplication context basis and you are using two application contexts,\\nyou won\\'t get those events.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n\\t...\\n\\tcnt = 0;\\n\\ttoplevel = XtAppInitialize(&app, class,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t   Desc, XtNumber (Desc),\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t   &argc, argv,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t   Fallback, args, cnt);\\n\\n\\tXtAddTimeOut (...)\\n\\tXtAddWorkProc (...)\\n\\n\\tXtAppMainLoop (app)\\n\\nwould never invoke the timeout.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n27. What is and how can I implement drag and drop?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n(Courtesy of Roger Reynolds, rogerr@netcom.com; 19 Feb 93)\\n\\nDrag-n-drop is a buzzword for moving data between clients, in an\\n``intuitive\\'\\' fashion.\\n\\nMotif Version 1.2 supports drag-n-drop capabilities, OpenLook has\\nsupported d-n-d all along.  The two protocols are not compatable with\\neach other, and so far as I know, they are not published.\\n\\nI wrote a package called RDD which is designed to be a flexible public\\nprotocol for doing drag \\'n drop operations between clients.  My\\nintention was to provide a tool which would make it easy for people to\\nsupport a \"standard\" drag-n-drop protocol in the programs they develop\\nand contribute or sell, regardless of what widget set is used (as long\\nas it is based on Xt).\\n\\nThe implementation is based upon my understanding of the ICCCM\\nconventions, for more details read the code.\\n\\nI have heard from dozens of people using RDD who like it and feel that\\nit works a whole lot better than Motif 1.2 stuff.  Also, there seem to\\nbe many who think that it is neat but are constrained to use Motif\\nanyway.\\n\\nThe latest RDD (and some other stuff) is available for ftp from\\nnetcom.com, in /pub/rogerr.  A (possibly older) version is also\\navailable on export.lcs.mit.edu in /contrib.\\n-- \\nPete Ware\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tware@cis.ohio-state.edu\\nCIS Dept, Ohio State University\\t\\t\\tw/ (614) 292-7318\\n228 Bolz Hall, 2036 Neil Ave.\\t\\t\\th/ (614) 538-0965\\nColumbus, OH 43210\\n'),\n",

Let's define a nuclear weapon as an explosive weapon\\n>whose majority of energy comes from fission and/or fusion of atomic\\n>nuclei.\\n\\n\\tAnd you've just described any civilian reactor because your\\ndefinition fails to note what energy is being considered.  Reactors\\nblow with a steam explosion, but the majority of energy still comes\\nfrom fission or fusion because that is what heated the coolant.  See\\nwhat a can of worms this is?  Last I heard, Ft. Calhoun station just\\nnorth of Omaha, Nebraska wasn't considered a weapon.  Given the\\nsodium-cooled breeder designs on the blocks now, I can easily envision\\nreactors being household appliances in under twenty years.  With the\\nPRISM design, there is *no* operator input needed on the reactor\\nitself, and it is not unreasonable to assume the secondary side can\\nbe made equally as automatic in the future.  So your definition is\\nflawed in a few respects already.\\n\\n>  Let's define a biological weapon as live organisms or viruses \\n>in such state, quantity, and with such a vector that they could cause \\n>death or serious disease [further defined] to a significant number of\\n>people if released in a city, similarly populated area, resevoir, or\\n>cropland.  \\n\\n\\tTyphoid Mary would likely fit this bill if she sneezed.  If\\nyou don't mind extrapolation, any HIV-positive person also fits this\\nbill if they interact with others in a way that stands any chance of\\nspreading the virus.  Finally, that manure pile I mention below fits\\nthis definition, as does, say, releasing a pet rattlesnake to the wild.\\n\\n>Nerve gas and mustard gas are well defined.  Other poisonous\\n>gasses should be individually banned only if it can be shown that there\\n>is no use not related to weaponry.  Licenses should be available for\\n>research purposes on such chemicals.\\n\\n\\tAnd I can show where any such gas has other uses.  For example,\\nperhaps we would like to rid the hay field of gophers.  Calcium Carbide\\nis a rock that dissolves in water to produce aceteylne gas.  It can\\nbe used for welding, in miners lamps, for gassing gophers, or for\\nmaking carbide bombs and doing some illicit fishing.  Toss some in a\\ntoilet and leave a lighted cigarette on the seat and you'll see that\\nit can also be a weapon, just like any other flammable substance.\\nSo, now my miners lamps won't work, I can't do any welding, and I\\nstill have those pesky gophers.\\n\\n>I am not a lawyer, but these ideas could certainly be a basis for \\n>definitions.\\n\\n\\tThe basis for, but I'm sure you see that the problem is not\\nin writing a law, it is in writing a law that cannot be abused and\\nextended beyond the point where it does any good.\\n\\n>>I'll give\\n>>you a little hint:  see that manure pile in the farmer's field down the\\n>>road?  In the USA, that is a weapon of mass destruction, \\n\\n>Nope.  It is not considered a weapon.\\n\\n\\tIt is under your proposed law.  So is a silage pit if there\\nis run-off.  So are underground fuel tanks.\\n\\n>>biological in\\n>>nature, because if it gets washed into an open well it will contaminate\\n>>the aquifers that supply thousands of cities with drinking water.  So,\\n>>where do *you* draw the line?  In the USA, the EPA has ruled that\\n>>a pile of scrap iron is illegal.  Care to draw a thinner line this time?\\n\\n>It is not defined as a weapon of mass destruction.  Many things are\\n>banned for other reasons.\\n\\n\\tIt meets all the criterion of a weapon.  It is an instrument that\\ncan be used for fighting, even though that is not its intended purpose,\\nand despite there being better weapons around.  Given that the aquifers\\nsupply a significant part of the country with drinking water, mass\\ndestruction is rather a given.\\n\\n\\tIt's not that certain weapons aren't something I'd rather not\\nsee a lot of people having.  The problem is that it is nearly\\nimpossible to write a law such that it cannot be abused upon some\\npretext or another.  The looser your definition, the more ripe for\\nabuse that law is.  Furthermore, if you get specific then the old\\nstandby is to insert a clause allowing the list of banned things to\\nbe added to, generally without going through the hassles of another\\nvote and public reading of the law.  Again, ripe for abuse.\\n\\n< Dan Sorenson, DoD #1066 z1dan@exnet.iastate.edu viking@iastate.edu >\\n<  ISU only censors what I read, not what I say.

My comments are based\\nprimarily on William Rusch\\'s historical summary in \"The Trinitarian\\nControversy\", Fortress.  I\\'m going to save this as an FAQ.  --clh]\\n\\nMAJOR VIEWS OF THE TRINITY\\n \\n[SECOND CENTURY\\n\\nThe writers of the 2nd Cent. are important, because they set up much\\nof the context for the later discussions.  Justin Martyr, Aristides,\\nAthenagoras, Tatian, and Theophilus of Antioch are known as the\\n\"Apologists\".  Their theology has often been described as \"Logos\\ntheology\".  Based strongly on wording in John, they took more or less\\na two-phase approach.  Through eternity, the Logos was with the\\nFather, as his mind or thought.  This \"immanent Word\" became\\n\"expressed\" as God revealed himself in history, ultimately in Jesus.\\nThus Jesus\\' full distinction from the Father only became visible in\\nhistory, though the Logos had been present in God from eternity.\\nRusch regards this view is containing many of the emphases of the\\nfinal orthodox position, but in a form which is less sophisticated,\\nbecause it did not have the technical language to properly deal with\\nthe eternal plurality in the Godhead.\\n\\nIrenaeus held views somewhat similar to the Apologists.  However he\\nwas uncomfortable with the two-stage approach.  He still viewed God as\\none personage, with distinctions that did not become fully visible\\nexcept through his process of self-revelation (the \"economy\").  The\\ndistinctions are present in his essential nature.  Irenaeus emphasized\\nthe Holy Spirit more than the Apologists.  Irenaeus\\' views should\\nprobably be called \"economic trinitarianism\", though that term is\\nnormally used (as below) to refer to later developments.\\n\\n\\nTHIRD CENTURY\\n\\n--clh]\\n\\nDynamic Monarchianism\\n \\nSource: Theodotus\\nAdherents: Paul of Samosota, Artemon, Socinus, Modern Unitarians\\nPerception of God\\'s Essence: The unity of God denotes both oneness of nature\\nand oneness of person. The Son and the Holy Spirit therefore are\\nconsubstantial with the Father\\'s divine essence only as impersonal attributes.\\nThe divine dunamis came upon the man Jesus, but he was not God in the strict\\nsense of the word.\\nPerception of God\\'s Subsistence: The notion of a subsistent God is a palpable\\nimpossibility, since his perfect unity is perfectly indivisible. The\\n\\'diversity\\' of God is apparent and not real, since the Christ event and the\\nwork of the Holy Spirit attest only to a dynamic operation within God, not to\\na hypostatic union.\\nAsignation of Deity/Eternality:\\n Father: Unique originator of the universe. He is eternal, self-existent, and\\nwithout beginning or end.\\n Son: A virtuous (but finite) man in whose life God was dynamically present in\\na unique way; Christ definitely was not deity though his humanity was deified.\\n Holy Spirit: An impersonal attribute of the Godhead. No deity or eternality\\nis ascribed to the Holy Spirit.\\nCriticism(s): Elevates reason above the witness of biblical revelation\\nconcerning the Trinity. Categorically denies the deity of Christ and of the\\nHoly Spirit, thereby undermining the theological undergirding for the biblical\\ndoctrine of salvation.\\n[In summary, this probably best thought of as not being Trinitarianism\\nat all.  God is an undifferentiated one.  Son and Holy Spirit are seen\\nas simply names for the man Jesus and the grace of God active in the\\nChurch.  --clh]\\n\\n \\nModalistic Monarchianism\\n \\nSource: Praxeas\\nAdherents: Noatus, Sabellius, Swedenborg, Scleiermacher, United Pentecostals\\n(Jesus Only)\\nPerception of God\\'s Essence: The unity of God is ultra-simplex. He is\\nqualitatively characterized in his essence by one nature and person.  This\\nessence may be designated interchangeably as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.\\nThey are different names for but identical with the unified, simplex God. The\\nthree names are the three modes by which God reveals Himself.\\nPerception of God\\'s Subsistence: The concept of a subsistent God is erroneous\\nand confounds the real issue of the phenomenon of God\\'s modalistic manifesting\\nof himself. The paradox of a subsisting \"three in oneness\" is refuted by\\nrecognizing that God is not three persons but one person with three different\\nnames and corresponding roles following one another like parts of a drama.\\nAsignation of Deity/Eternality:\\n Father: Fully God and fully eternal as the primal mode or manifestation of\\nthe only unique and unitary God\\n Son: Full deity/eternality ascribed only in the sense of his being another\\nmode of the one God and identical with his essence. he is the same God\\nmanifested in temporal sequence specific to a role (incarnation).\\n Holy Spirit: Eternal God only as the tile designates the phase in which the\\none God, in temporal sequence, manifested himself pursuant to the role of\\nregeneration and sanctification.\\nCriticism(s): Depersonalizes the Godhead. To compensate for its Trinitarian\\ndeficiencies, this view propounds ideas that are clearly heretical. Its\\nconcept of successive manifestations of the Godhead cannot account for such\\nsimultaneous appearances of the three persons as at Christ\\'s baptism.\\n[Rusch comments that evidence on these beliefs is sketchy.  There are\\nactually two slightly different groups included: Noetus and his\\nfollowers, and Sabellius.  Noetus was apparently more extreme.\\nSabellius followed him, and attempted to use some features of economic\\nTrinitarianism to create a more sophisticated view.  Unfortunately,\\ninformation about Sabellius comes from a century later, and there\\nseems to be some confusion between him and Marcellus of Ancyra. --clh]\\n \\n[I\\'ve moved the following description to be with the other\\nthird-century views.  It originally appeared near the end.  --clh]\\n\\n\"Economic\" Trinitarianism\\n \\nSource: Hippolytus, Tertullian\\nAdherents: Various \"neo-economic\" Trinitarians\\nPerception of God\\'s Essence: The Godhead is characterized by triunity: Father,\\nSon, and Holy Spirit are the three manifestations of one identical,\\nindivisible substance. The perfect unity and consubstantiality are especially\\ncomprehended in such manifest Triadic deeds as creation and redemption.\\nPerception of God\\'s Subsistence: Subsistence within the Godhead is articulated\\nby means of such terms as \"distinction\" and \"distribution\" dispelling\\neffectively the notion of separateness or division.\\nAsignation of Deity/Eternality:\\nThe equal deity of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit is clearly elucidated in\\nobservation of the simultaneous relational/operational features of the\\nGodhead. Co-eternality, at times, does not intelligibly surface in this\\nambiguous view, but it seems to be a logical implication.\\nCriticism(s): Is more tentative and ambiguous in its treatment of the\\nrelational aspect of the Trinity.\\n[Note that this is a development of the Apologists and Irenaeus, as\\nmentioned above.  As with them, the threeness is visible primarily in\\nthe various ways that God revealed himself in history.  However they\\ndid say that this is a manifestation of a plurality that is somehow\\npresent in the Godhead from the beginning.  Tertullian talks of\\nthe Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as being three that are one in\\nsubstance.  Many people regard this view as being essentially\\northodox, but with less developed philosophical categories.  --clh]\\n\\n[Origen, developing further an approach started by Clement, attempted\\nto apply neo-Platonism to Christian thought.  He set many of the terms\\nof the coming battle.  In Platonic fashion, he sees the Son as a\\nmediator, mediating between the absolute One of God and the plurality\\nof creating beings.  The Son is generated, but he is \"eternally\\ngenerated\".  That is, the relationship between Father and Son is\\neternal.  It cannot be said that \"there was once when he was not\" (a\\nphrase that will haunt the discussion for centuries).  Having the Son\\nis intrinsic to his concept of God.  The Father and Son are described\\nas separate \"hypostases\", though this may not have quite the meaning\\nof separate subsistence that it had in some contexts.  The union is\\none of love and action, but there is some reason to think that he may\\nhave used the term homoousios (\"of the same substance\").  The Holy\\nSpirit is also an active, personal substance, originated by the Father\\nthrough the Son.  Origen\\'s intent is trinitarian, not tritheistic, but\\nhe pushes things in the direction of separateness.\\n\\n\\nFOURTH CENTURY\\n\\n--clh]\\n\\nSubordinationism  [often called Arianism --clh]\\n \\nSource: Arius\\nMajor Adherents: Modern Jehovah\\'s Witnesses, and several other lesser known\\ncults\\nPerception of God\\'s Essence: The inherent oneness of God\\'s nature is properly\\nidentifiable with the Father only. The Son and the Holy Spirit are discreet\\nentities who do not share the divine essence.\\nPerception of God\\'s Subsistence: The unipersonal essence of God precludes the\\nconcept of divine subsistence with a Godhead. \"Threeness in oneness\" is self-\\ncontradictory and violates biblical principles of a monotheistic God.\\nAsignation of Deity/Eternality:\\n Father: The only one, unbegotten God who is eternal and without beginning.\\n Son: A created being and therefore not eternal. Though he is to be venerated,\\nhe is not of the divine essence.\\n Holy Spirit: A nonpersonal, noneternal emanation of the Father. He is viewed\\nas an influence, an expression of God.  Deity is not ascribed to him.\\nCriticism(s): It is at variance with abundant scriptural testimony respecting\\nthe deity of both Christ and the Holy Spirit. Its hierarchial concept likewise\\nasserts three essentially separate persons with regard to the Father, Christ,\\nand the Holy Spirit. This results in a totally confused soteriology.\\n[Note also that in most versions of this view, the Son is not fully\\nhuman either.  He is supernatural and sinless.  That distinguishes this\\nview from adoptionism.  --clh]\\n \\nOrthodox Trinitarianism\\n \\nSource: Athanasius\\nAdherents: Basil, Gregory of Nyssa, Gregory of Nazianzus, Augustine, Thomas\\nAquinas, Luther, Calvin, Contemporary orthodox Christianity\\nPerception of God\\'s Essence: God\\'s being is perfectly unified and simplex: of\\none essence.  This essence of deity is held in common by Father, Son, and Holy\\nSpirit.

As such, the Godhead exists \"undivided in\\ndivided persons.\" This view contemplates an identity in nature and cooperation\\nin function without the denial of distinctions of persons in the Godhead.\\nAsignation of Deity/Eternality:\\nIn its final distillation, this view unhesitatingly sets forth Father, Son,\\nand Holy Spirit as co-equal and co-eternal in the Godhead with regard to both\\nthe divine essence and function.\\nCriticism(s): The only shortcoming has to do with the limitations inherent in\\nhuman language and thought itself: the impossibility of totally describing the\\nineffable mystery of \"three in oneness.\"\\n[At least in the 4th Cent, there were several different approaches, all\\nof which fit the description here, and all regarded as orthodox, but which\\nare somewhat different in detail.  Nicea was originally held to respond\\nto Arius.  Arius can be thought of as carrying Origen\\'s thought a bit\\ntoo far, to the point of making the Son a separate entity.  In general\\nthe East tended to take an approach based on Origen\\'s, and it was hard\\nto get acceptance of Nicea in the East.  Its final acceptance was\\nbased on the work of Athanasius with the Cappadocians: Gregory of Nyssa and\\nGregory of Nazianzus, among others.

I\\'ve known\\nall sorts of Christians, ranging from the trendiest of liberals to\\nthe fire-breathing fundamentalists, and although many on the \\nconservative side of the Christian faith do claim that the Bible is\\na (perhaps *the*) source of absolute truth, I don\\'t know of anyone\\nwho treats it as anything other than a valuable part of a living tradition.\\nWhile I am not a Roman Catholic, I believe this is close to the official\\nposition of the RC church (perhaps an RC would like to comment).\\n\\nThe particular practice you refer to will usually be explained in\\nterms of the social context of the time. You would think the fact \\nthat the conservatives seem to have to break out the tophat-and-cane \\nand give you some big song-and-dance routine about why this \\n(other passages as well) aren\\'t directly applicable today would \\nshow them that what they claim about the Bible and what they \\nactually practice are two different things, but mostly it doens\\'t.\\n\\nWhile this thread is supposed to be about the arrogance of Christians,\\nI would suggest that some of the problem is really hypocrasy, in this\\ncase, making claims about the Bible which the claimants don\\'t actually\\nput into practice. But if we step back from the name-calling and\\nlook at what people are attempting to say, we see that they are trying\\nto express very concisely the unique place the Bible holds within the\\nChristian faith. So when people use such words or phrases as \"Word of\\nGod\", \"inerrant\", \"infallibale\", \"The Manufacturer\\'s Handbook\", \"The\\nonly rule of faith and practice in the church today\" to describe the\\nBible, we should try to hear what they are saying and not just look at\\nthe mere words they use. Some of the above descriptions are demostratably\\nfalse and others are self-contradictory, but in my experience people are\\ngenerally pretty good at picking out the intention of the speaker even\\nwhen the speaker\\'s words are at variance with their intentions. A Biblical\\nexample is from the garden of Eden where God asks \"Where are you?\" and Adam\\nexplains that he was naked and afraid and hid himself. If Adam had\\nanswered God\\'s words he would have said something like \"I\\'m here in this\\ntree.\" The problem seems to arise when Christians insist that these\\nwords are indeed accurate reflections of their beleif. Most people\\nhave not made a determined effort to work out their own understanding of\\nthe place of the Bible within their own faith and so rely on the phrases\\nand explanations that others use.\\n\\nI hope this helps.\\n--\\n                                                                     ___\\nBill Rea                                                            (o o)\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------w--U--w---\\n| Bill Rea, Computer Services Centre, | E-Mail   b.rea@csc.canterbury.ac.nz |\\n| University of Canterbury,           | or     cctr114@csc.canterbury.ac.nz |\\n| Christchurch, New Zealand           | Phone (03)-642-331 Fax (03)-642-999 |\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n'),\n",

Let me tell you the problems I had, and I took care\\nof this car, I put alot of miles on it in the first couple years, but took\\nit to every checkup it needed, and many that shouldn\\'t have been.\\n\\n1988 Dodge Shadow ES\\n\\nThese were replaced within the 4 years that I owned the car.\\n\\nEngine \\n4 Alternators\\nRear Suspension Torsion Bar\\n2 Water pumps\\n5 thermostats\\nHall effect sensor\\nMain computer\\n4 Batteries\\n\\nThese were rebuilt/repaired\\n\\nRadiator\\nAutomatic Transmission\\nPower Steering\\n\\n\\nThose are just the things I can remember off the top of my head.  For\\nabout a year before I sold the car, I said to myself, it\\'s a good car, I\\njust can\\'t find anybody competent enough the fix it.  In the end, before I\\ntraded it in for a Saturn, the power steering started acting up again.  I\\njust stopped putting money into it.  I must have put at least $5000-$7000\\nworth of repairs over it\\'s lifetime.  I am sorry but Lee Iacocca can bite\\nme.  Bullshit, whoever backs em best, is just afraid the stupid things are\\ngoing to fall apart, and no one will buy them without assurance, why the\\nhell do you think that LH has been nicknamed Last Hope.\\n\\nYou can do better, and I know people will disagree with me here, but\\nJapanese, like Honda, or Toyota, or the only american car company that I\\nfeel is a quality product, Saturn.  I will not touch another chrysler\\nproduct again, no way.  I don\\'t care how good the LH cars look good, and I\\nwill admit they look promising, but not with the support that you get.  GM\\nisn\\'t much better, thank god, they don\\'t control Saturn, like they do\\ntheir divisions, or it would be just another marketing ploy.  \\n\\nDon\\'t get me wrong, i will be watching my car (which I do like) like a\\nhawk for the next 4 years.  I am much more hesitant to say it (or any) car\\nis really good, until it has proved itself to me.\\n\\nBut since someone else pointed out C&D as a source.  I will note, because\\nI used to read these magazines, that Car and Driver has never had a good\\nthing to say about most Chrysler products (Shadow for one), always were\\nthey moaning about the reguritated K-car, and engine.  Whereas Motor Trend\\nalways thought they were great cars.  No car magazine is really objective.\\n\\nAnd although there are alot of people who don\\'t like Consumers Reports, I\\nwill use them to reinforce my argument (I already know about the big stink\\nwith the Saturn crash tests, time will tell how good a car they are), the\\nshadow/sundance rate much worse than average, in fact none of the\\nchrysler\\'s rate a better than average, I think the best one is just\\naverage.  Excluding the diamond star/mitsubishi stuff and the LH\\'s.  You\\ncan find bad stuff about the Shadow.  Try as I might, when I researched\\nthe Saturn, I could not find anything bad about it.  There is a great deal\\nof information about this company, just because it is a new american\\ncompany and it has created quite a stir in the automotive community, for\\ngood reason.  Much more than the introduction of any new model lines of\\nany established company.  I read an article, which had a sub-column, an I\\nthink this imprinted on me more than anything else.  Some big wig in\\nToyota said and I quote, \"We are watching them very closely.\"  Come on,\\neverybody grow up, the foreign cars, especially the japanese have been\\nkicking our butts, for good reason, the american car companies could not make\\na good product or support the customer the way they want these days, to\\nset in their ways, which is one of the reasons Saturn was created.  They\\nare still struggling because they haven\\'t learned yet.  They have the\\nability, the workers are not inferior, the technology is not out of date,\\nbut their attitude is, and they are just finding this out.  It\\'s called\\ncompetition gentleman/women if you don\\'t satisfy the demand of the\\nconsumer, well your out..  \\n\\n*asbestos suit on*\\n\\nGaia\\n\\n'),\n",

Carpenter) writes:\\n>\\n>> I'm wondering if it's possible to use radio waves to measure the\\n>> distance between a transmitter(s) and receiver?\\n>\\n>Yes. It's called RADAR.\\nWell, actually not quite. Both Radar and Radio-Altimeters measure distances\\nby measuring the time required to transmit a signal, then receive its\\nreflection from a target. Radar generally uses pulses, while Radio Altimeters\\nuse either pulses or a modulated continuous-wave transmission. In the case of\\nthe latter, highly accurate distance measurement can be made. As an example,\\nthe original Bendix ALA-52 Radio Altimeter was accurate to 1/8 foot at 2500\\nfeet altitude.\\n\\nNote, however that this is a different method of measuring than the poster\\noriginally asked about. The problem with gaining accurate measurements between\\na transmitter and a seperate receiver is that you need a highly accurate\\ntime base which starts at the receiver at the exact instant the transmitter\\ntriggers. This cannot be wire connected, since radio waves will actually\\ntravel faster in free-space (air, in this case) than wire (the difference\\nis called the velocity factor of the cable). So you need to resort to a\\ncommon timebase that is automatically corrected for distance, etc. Something\\nlike a PLL connected to a GPS receiver should do the trick, triggering both\\nthe transmitter and receiver simultaneously. Sound expensive? Not too bad,\\nbut plan on spending a few bucks in both equipment and effort.\\n\\nWhy not go to a different method? Surveyors use a laser-light system where again\\nthe reflection time is measured. Why not try this? (Sounds like something a P.E.\\nshould know about anyway ;-).\\n\\n>> Seems to me that you should be able to measure the signal strength\\n>> and determine distance. This would be for short distances (2000 ft),\\n>> and I would need to have accuracy of 6 inches, or so.\\n\\nThis is actually highly inaccurate, since the power output of a transmitter\\nvaries from unit to unit, there are variances in the antenna and transmission\\nline, and the receiver may also vary, both from unit to unit, and the same unit\\nover time. You would need to continuously calibrate the entire system. With\\nthe radio altimeter this is also done, but since everything is located at\\none place, it is much easier to do. Note especially that the time base for\\nthe R.A. receiver and transmitter is one unit also...\\n\\n>Depends on the environment: in a static environent such as a waveguide yes, in\\n>a dynamic environment (with objects moving about) the multipath kills this\\n>concept.\\n\\nNope. FM capture effect says that the strongest signal wins. That is, unless\\nthe two interfering signals are seperated by more than 3 db in signal strength.\\nThis is the one problem that makes altimeters inaccurate at very low altitudes.\\nSignals bouncing off runways tend to be VERY strong...\\n\\n>> What frequencies would be best for this? Or does matter?\\n\\nAs high as possible to eliminate outside influence, and also to enhance\\nattenuation of multipath signals. Radio Altimeters typically use frequencies\\naround 4 GHz.\\n\\nHope this helps...\\n\\n-- \\n==========================================================\\nJack Brindle\\nham radio: wa4fib\\ninternet: jackb@mdd.comm.mot.com\\n\"),\n",

Here is some \\ninformation \"from the horse\\'s mouth\".\\n\\n(Regarding the sufficient overwriting of media (\"clearing\") meant to \\nbe *retained* within the controlled environment, or declassifying \\nthe material to be reused *outside* the controlled environment,)\\n\\nFrom National Telecommunications and Information Systems \\nSecurity (NTISS) \"Advisory Memorandum on Office Automation \\nSecurity Guidelines\"  (NTISSAM COMPUSEC/1/87):\\n\\n------\\n\\n\"7.6.2.1 Clearing of Magnetic Media\\n\\nCertain types of removable media (e.g., magnetic tape, floppy disk, \\ncassettes, and magnetic cards) may be cleared by overwriting the \\nentire media one time with any one character.  Floppy disks may be \\ncleared by applying a vendor\\'s formatting program that overwrites \\neach location with a given character.\\n\\nFixed media (e.g., Winchester disks) should be cleared by overwriting \\nat least one time with any one character.  One way to do this is by \\napplying a vendor-supplied formatting program that overwrites each \\nlocation on the disk with a given character, if it can be shown that \\nthis program actually works as advertised.  The user should beware: \\nsome programs that purport to overwrite all locations do not \\nactually do this.\\n\\nCleared media may be resides within the controlled facility or \\nreleased for destruction; however, they should be marked and \\ncontrolled at the level of the most restrictive sensitivity of \\ninformation ever recorded.\\n\\n7.6.2.2 Declassification of Magnetic Media\\n\\nCertain types of removable media can be declassified using a \\ndegaussing device that has been approved for declassifying media of \\nthat type.  (A list of approved devices is maintained by the NSA.)\\n\\nIf a fixed medium (for example, a hard, or Winchester, disk) is \\noperative, an approved method of declassifying the disk pack is to \\nemploy an overwrite procedure which must overwrite all \\naddressable locations at least three times by writing any character, \\nthen its complement (e.g., binary ones and binary zeros) \\nalternatively.\\n\\nWhen fixed  media become inoperative, it is impossible to declassify \\nthe media by the overwrite method.  In this case, there are two \\nalternate procedures that may be used: (1) disassemble the disk \\npack, and degauss each platter with the appropriate approved \\ndegaussing equipment; and (2) courier the inoperative media to the \\nvendor\\'s facility, have the magnetic media (e.g., disk platter) \\nremoved in sight of the courier and returned to the courier for \\ndestruction at the secure site.  The vendor can then install new \\nplatters and repair any other problems with the disk unit.\\n\\n7.6.3 Destruction of Magnetic Media\"\\n\\n[see DoD Computer Security Center, \"Department of Defense Magnetic \\nRemanence Security Guideline\", CSC-STD-003-85  FOR OFFICIAL USE \\nONLY]\\n\\n------\\n\\nThis and many other interesting documents (many that are more \\ninformative than probably intended) on computer security procedures \\ncan be obtained (free) from:\\n\\nExecutive Secretary\\nNational Telecommunications and Informations\\n  Systems Security Committee\\nNational Security Agency\\nFort George G.

Both spacecraft will team up with\\nground-based radio telescopes located around the world to create\\na radio telescope network that astronomers hope will expand radio\\ntelescope observing power by a factor of 10.\\n     Japan\\'s VSOP satellite will use a limited six-hour orbit to\\nconduct imaging science, while the Russian RADIOASTRON spacecraft\\nwill exploit a larger, 28-hour Earth orbit to conduct exploratory\\nradio astronomy. Each satellite will point at a source target for\\nroughly 24 hours, while approximately 20 ground-based radio\\ntelescopes will simultaneously point at the same source object\\nwhile within view on Earth.\\n     According to Dr. Joel Smith, JPL\\'s project manager for the\\nU.S. Space VLBI, meetings like those held at JPL will permit\\nJapan and Russia, who have little previous experience in radio\\ninterferometry, to establish working relationships with the radio\\nastronomy communities that will be vital during the complex\\nobservations required by the Space VLBI project.\\n     \"One of our main activities is developing the methodology\\nfor international coordination, because the two spacecraft\\nsimultaneously rely on the corresponding tracking stations while\\nusing the ground-based radio telescopes to observe the same\\ncelestial objects,\" said Smith.\\n     Three new tracking antennas are being built at DSN\\nfacilities and other three other tracking facilities located in\\nJapan, Russia and Green Bank, W.Va. This global network of\\nground-based radio telescopes will use precision clocks and\\nhigh-speed recorders to collect observation data and forward the\\ninformation to a correlator located at the National Radio\\nAstronomy Observatory in Socorro, N.M. The correlator will\\ncombine and process data, then make it available to mission\\ninvestigators in Moscow, Tokyo, and JPL via electronic mail.\\n     Smith is optimistic that the massive radio telescope created\\nby the Space VLBI network will provide radio astronomers with\\nbetter resolution than has ever been achieved before by\\nground-based radio telescopes, allowing astronomers to take a\\ncloser look at distant objects in space.\\n     \"There is a long history of radio astronomy using\\nground-based telescopes,\" said Smith. \"What we intend to do is to\\nextend radio astronomy into Earth orbit. Our goal is to look\\ndeeper into the cores of galactic nuclei, quasars and other\\nactive radio sources to understand what drives those things we\\nhave seen so far with radio astronomy.\"\\n     Smith noted that if one examines \"the active galactic\\nnuclei, you\\'ll find jets appearing to spew at speeds greater than\\nlight, and at energy levels that are millions of times greater\\nthan you would expect.\"\\n     He said some astronomers believe that black holes may be\\nlocated in the cores of these galaxies, and that they may fuel\\nthe jets. Smith hopes that \"by using Space VLBI to look further\\ninto the cores, this theory may be supported or disproved.\"\\n     Russian space-flight hardware, including transponders and\\ntransmitters, are now being tested in the United States, and\\nJapanese hardware is scheduled to arrive for testing later this\\nyear. Analysis of this hardware will permit U.S. scientists and\\nengineers to understand how to modify the high-speed VLBA\\nCorrelator operating at the NRAO in order to accommodate the odd\\ndata patterns that will originate from the more than 20\\nground-based radio telescopes involved in Space VLBI.\\n     Smith is particularly pleased that meetings with the\\nJapanese and Russian space agency officials -- like those held at\\nJPL in March -- have proceeded smoothly. Yet he knows that the\\npolitical uncertainty in Russia could jeopardize that country\\'s\\nparticipation in the project.\\n     \"Nothing is ever smooth,\" he said, \"but the Russians have\\nbeen incredibly open with us. We always anticipated some\\nlikelihood that we will not succeed because of political factors\\nbeyond our control, yet there tends to be a way of keeping these\\nthings going, because scientists on both sides are trying hard,\\nand people recognize the value of cooperation at this level.\"\\n     Smith points out that the Japanese space agency has more at\\nstake than just fulfilling an international commitment to a\\nscience mission.\\n     \"The Japanese have been extremely cooperative, since\\ninternational cooperation is essential to their science mission,\"\\nhe said.\\n     But Smith also noted that Japanese space agency officials\\nlook at the U.S. Space VLBI mission as an opportunity to showcase\\nthe technology involved with VSOP spacecraft, and their highly\\nregarded Mach V launch vehicle.\\n     Yet regardless of the risks involved in undertaking such an\\nambitious project, JPL\\'s Smith is satisfied that planning for the\\nSpace VLBI Project is beyond the significant financial and\\npolitical hurdles that otherwise might threaten the project.\\n     \"Fortunately, we have the virtue of having two partners, and\\nif either falls out, we would still have something with the\\nother. By themselves, both spacecraft are independent,\\nscientifically exciting missions.\"\\n                           ###\\n     ___    _____     ___\\n    /_ /|  /____/ \\\\  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov\\n    | | | |  __ \\\\ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab |\\n ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand\\n/___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and\\n|_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.\\n\\n'),\n",

Claiming that that truth is absolute, though, seems \\nto imply a literal reading of the Bible.  If it were absolute truth \\n(constant across time, culture, etc.) then no interpretation would be \\nnecessary.\\n\\nIt may be that the lessons gleaned from various passages are different \\nfrom person to person.  To me, that doesn't mean that one person is \\nright and the other is wrong.  I believe that God transcends our simple \\nminds, and that scripture may very well have been crafted with exactly \\nthis intent.  God knows me, and knows that my needs are different \\nfrom yours or anyone else's.  By claiming that scripture is absolute,\\nthen at least one person in every disputed interpretation must be wrong.\\nI just don't believe that God is that rigid.\\n\\n> >Evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture \\n> >to be absolute truth.  (And there are plenty of other examples.)\\n> >Can you reconcile this?\\n>\\n> Sure.  The Bible preaches absolute truths.

Since these principles \\nare crystal clear to evangelicals, maybe the rest of us should just take\\ntheir word for it?  Maybe it isn't at all crystal clear to *me* that \\ntheir fundamental principles are either fundamental *or* principles.\\n\\nI think we've established that figuring out Biblical truth is a matter \\nof human interpretation and therefore error-prone.  Yet you can still \\nclaim that some of them may be crystal clear?

I don\\'t think so, not from what I heard. He lived\\n>ONE DAY of suffering and died. If the wages of sin is the above paragraph, then\\n>JESUS DIDN\\'T PAY FOR OUR SINS, DID HE?\\n\\nThis is something I\\'ve always found a little curious. I\\'ve never quite understood\\nthe trinity thing. On the one hand, Jesus is supposed to be God incarnate. But,\\nat the same time, he is God\\'s son \"For God so loved the world that he gave his\\nonly begotten son\". First question is, if Jesus was God in human form, how could\\nhe really be God\\'s son? If the Holy Ghost \"planted the seed\" in Mary, so to speak,\\nthen it seems that Jesus\\' relationship to God would be the equivalent to the\\nhuman father/son relationship. While a son might inherit alot of the father\\'s \\nqualities, he is not the father. They are still two separite entities. To try\\nand say that a son is the same person as the father is obviously wrong. In that\\ncase, Jesus and God aren\\'t the same. On the other hand, if their relationship\\nisn\\'t the same as the human father/son relationship, but Jesus is actually God\\nincarnate, then he\\'s not really God\\'s son and he never was. He\\'s just God\\nmanifesting himself as Jesus. At least, this is how I\\'m seeing it. Can someone\\nwho is more knowledgeable about the trinity enlighten us? \\n\\nGetting back to the original question, what is the great price that Jesus paid\\nto redeem our sins? Was it dying on the cross? Since Jesus knew that he would\\nrise again in 3 days and then ascend back to heaven, I have a hard time seeing\\nhow this is considered paying such a great price for humanity. His earthly body\\nmay have been killed, but then, so what? He suffered a few hours of physical\\npain, but then, there has been many a human who has suffered a great deal more.\\nThe fact that Jesus was God\\'s only begotten son doesn\\'t seem to me to have much\\nmeaning since God can beget as many sons as he wants to. Jesus being the only\\none was simply a matter of choice. I suspect that these questions will be very\\noffensive to many Christians on this net. To those people, please accept my\\nsincere apologies. It is not my intention to offend or to trivialize Christ.\\nBut, I do believe these are legitimate questions and I am genuinely curious.\\n \\n[Note that the Trinity and Incarnation have to be looked at together.\\nFirst, your reading of the Virgin Birth is an uncommon one.  (In this\\ngroup, it\\'s dangerous to say that no one believes something.)  You\\nseem to be suggesting the Jesus is God\\'s son in a physical sense,\\nwith the Holy Spirit as Father and Mary as Mother.  I consider that\\nterrible heresy, though some people react less violently.  The Virgin\\nBirth says that Jesus\\' birth is God\\'s responsibility.  But it doesn\\'t\\nimply that God\\'s sperm was involved.  Indeed one (though by no means\\nthe only) speculation is that God used Joseph\\'s genetic material.\\n\\nSecond, Jesus is in some sense doubly indirect from the Father.  In a\\nTrinitarian context, the term Son refers to the eternal Logos, who is\\na part of God.  The Son didn\\'t come into existence with Jesus\\' birth.\\nJesus is the incarnation of the Son.  So his sonness isn\\'t\\nspecifically a result of being incarnated.  Rather, it\\'s the Son\\nwho was incarnated.\\n\\n--clh]\\n'),\n",

That means if the Isles\\nbeat the Devils on Friday, the will meet the Caps in the playoffs.\\n\\n\\tHowever, I have some more comments on the Islanders and hockey in\\ngeneral that I need to get off my chest :).  First of all, with the Islanders \\nback-to-back lackluster performances against the Whalers, one may think that \\nthe Islanders are out of shape.  These guys always suck wind in the 2nd period,\\ncome on a little in the 3rd and run out of gas too soon.  It is unbelieveable\\nhow many one goal games these guys have lost.  Anyway, the games was pretty \\nwide open.  The Isles still have tons of trouble scoring.  The Whalers played \\na golie in is 1st NHL start, I think his name was Lenarduzzi (sp?).  (His NHL \\ndebut was the Tuesday tie against the Isles).  Like I mentioned before, this \\nguy looked like the best golie on the planet for a while (until he misplayed a \\nMahlakov slap shot to go to OT).  I say it\\'s because the Isles don\\'t shoot \\ncorrectly.  Has anyone else noticed this?\\n\\n\\tAlso, I think it is really a shame for hockey when I guy like Mick\\nVukota gets as much ice time as he does.  This guy has about as much hockey\\ntalent as Jiggs MacDonald (who did play hockey, I think).  Anytime he gets the\\npuck it gets stolen, and he always starts fights and gets needless penalties. \\nRichard Pilon is another guy who is on the ice to stir up crap.  And he\\'s a\\ndefenseman.  He\\'s got to be approaching negative infinity for his plus/minus. \\nThis guy gets beaten all the time.  Why the need for such \"enforcers\"?  Not\\nonly do fights slow the game down ALOT, but it takes away from the guys who are\\nreally trying to play the game.  I\\'ll be one of the few to admit, I do enjoy a \\ngood fight once in a while, but only when it\\'s \"called for\".  You know, when a\\nguy checks the goalie too hard.  In other words, a violation of \"hockey ethics\"\\nmight cause you to get puched.  But there is no need to start crap when you are\\nlosing or becuase you can get away with it!! Does anyone agree that referees\\nneed to be a little less lenient in the 3rd and OT?  I mean COME ON already. \\nI\\'m sick of seeing teams pulling guys down, holding guys etc. just becuase the\\nreferee doesn\\'t call it.  OT and late in the 3rd should be a time for strategy,\\nnot physical prowess.  Trying to set up a goal should be first and foremost. \\nIf you are so afraid that the other team is going to score that you have to\\npull a guy down to prevent it, you don\\'t deserve to win in the first place.\\n\\nJust My Honest Opinion,\\n\\nGary at Hofstra\\nACCGSG@VAXB.HOFSTRA.EDU\\nACCGSG@HOFSTRA.BITNET\\n'),\n",

So the math says that nothing can enter a black hole.\\n\\nIt seems to me that you are mis-using physical intuition here.  My point is\\nthat you are talking about global conditions influencing local phenomena\\ninappropriately.  Remember that there is no such thing as a \"global\" frame\\nof reference for time.  Our minds like to pretend that there is, and we \\nimagine things like the calendar on Alpha Centaury being approx. 4 years off \\nfrom ours on Earth.\\nThis is simply wrong.  There is NO global \"time\" which can be applied to\\nevents on Alpha Centaury concurrently with events on Earth.  This is what\\nSpecial Relativity has taught us.  If I am travelling past the Earth at\\na high rate of speed toward A.C. I can even have a different view of the \\n_order_ of the occurance of events on A.C. versus Earth.  Thus, the answer to \\nthe question, \"what\\'s happening on Alpha Centaury NOW?\" is NOT well-defined, if\\nasked on Earth, until you specify all the relevant parameters such as relative\\nvelocities and the like; AND it will have different answers for different \\nvalues of these parameters.\\nNow, in the vicinity of a black hole, the curvature of spacetime becomes \\nimportant enough that this lack of a global frame of reference becomes \\nvery important.  In particular, the frame used by a distant observer is quite \\ndifferent from the frame appropriate to the falling object.  Our minds just \\ndon\\'t seem able to easily deal with the idea that time itself could be \\nbehaving differently in these two locations, but the equations of relativity \\nsay that it does.  We would _like_ to say \"the falling object is hovering\\nabove the horizon, NOW\", for an object whose frame has rotated wholly \"away\"\\nfrom ours.  In a very real sense, once the object has fallen into the hole\\nits gone forever from our ken.  Unless you volunteer to jump in after it,\\nthat is... :-)\\n\\n\\n Gene Battin\\n battin@cyclops.iucf.indiana.edu\\n no .sig yet\\n\\n'),\n",

Dunno how much it costs\\n    due to recent price increases, but I\\'d imagine over $400.\\n    That may be pushing my limit.  Advantages include the fact\\n    that I can later add the pants, and that it nearly eliminates\\n    the need for the jacket portion of a rainsuit.\\n\\n2)  Buy some kind of leather jacket.  I like a few of the new \\n    Hein-Gericke FirstGear line, however they may be a bit pricey\\n    unless I can work some sort of deal.  Advantages of leather\\n    are potentially slightly better protection, enhanced pose\\n    value (we all know how important that is :-), possibly cheaper\\n    than upper Aerostich.\\n\\nRequirements for a jacket are that it must fit over a few other \\nlayers (mainly a sizing thing), if leather i\\'d prefer a zip-out \\nlining, it MUST have some body armor similar to aerostich (elbows, \\nshoulders, forearms, possibly back/kidney protection, etc.), a \\nreasonable amount of pocket space would be nice, ventilation would \\nbe a plus, however it must be wearable in cold weather (below\\nfreezing) with layers or perhaps electrics.\\n\\nPlease fire away with suggestions, comments, etc...\\n\\nSteve\\n--\\n-- \\n Steve Andersen  DoD #0239                               andersen@me.udel.edu\\n (302) 832-0136                                     andersen@zr1.ccm.udel.edu\\n 1992 Ducati 907 I.E.                                      1987 Yamaha SRX250\\n \"Life is simply a consequence of the complexities of carbon chemistry...\"\\n'),\n",

I know it\\'s ambiguous.  I\\'ve told you the sense in\\nwhich I\\'m using it (worth, use, goodness, etc).  And value DOESN\\'T mean\\naccuracy, by any stretch of the imagination.  Value=result of a computation,\\nis not what I mean, but I accept it as a possible misinterpretation of\\n\\'value\\'.  Value == accuracy comes from out of left field.  \\n\\nI can only understand that by \\'\"useful in making some conclusion\" is an accuracy\\njudgement\\' you mean one can judge whether it is *really* useful in making\\nthat conclusion or not.   That\\'s part of what I mean by objective\\nvaluation - values grounded in solid facts.  One doesn\\'t value x for the \\npurpose y if all the evidence suggests that x doesn\\'t really do that. The\\nrest of what I mean is that the really fundamental values (e.g.  our own \\nfreedom) are solid facts in themselves.\\n\\nConsider each of the following statements:\\n\\n(1) The only reason that the distinction between \\'accurate\\' and \\n\\'inaccurate\\' exists at all is that a group of people finds it useful.  \\n\\n(2) The main reason that science exists at all is that a group of people\\nfinds the distinction between \\'accurate\\' and \\'inaccurate\\' useful in\\ndealing with phenomena.\\n\\n(3) Scientists find simple theories with accurate predictions useful in\\nmodelling phenomena.\\n\\nWhere is the \\'pun\\' of which you speak?  Where am I arguing from idiom?  \\nAnd what is wrong, if those statements are true, with concluding that \"the \\nbasis of science is its *judged* usefulness in dealing with phenomena, i.e. \\n\\'subjective\\' values\"?    After all, what on earth is (3), if not a \\n\\'subjective\\' value judgement?  (an \\'accurate\\' value judgement, maybe?)\\n\\nJust to illustrate what I mean: what\\'s the difference between saying\\n\\'simple theories with accurate predictions are the best tools we have\\nto model phenomena\\' and (say) \\'Love and intelligence are the best tools we have\\nto achieve freedom\\'?  Is one \\'objective\\', the other not?  Both are \\njudgements about value (\"best\"), and both have the same empirical basis, from \\nwhere _I_ sit.\\n\\n#Sorry, Frank, but all you\\'re doing is\\n#using the ambiguity of English to obfuscate the issue. IF you\\n#mean to say that science is based on value (accuracy) judgements,\\n#I have no problem with that. If you mean to say that it\\'s based\\n#on value (goodness) judgements, that\\'s nonsense. By contrast,\\n#morality is clearly based on goodness judgements.\\n\\nI\\'m afraid I do mean to say that it\\'s based on \"goodness\" judgements.\\n\"Simple theories with accurate predictions are better (_better_, BETTER) \\ntools for interpreting reality than complex theories with inaccurate \\npredictions\" is a fundamental value judgement that scientists make.

ABC aired a report including the 911 tapes \\nfrom Monday. The FBI called 911 within 4 minutes of the fire\\'s breakout. \\nUnfortunately, dispatch of vehicles outside the Waco city limits \\nrequired approval of a deputy chief, who was not available (literally \\nout to lunch?); the 911 operator desperately called around to local \\ncommunity volunteer fire departments to get something out there. By \\nthe time trucks arrived 27 minutes later, the whole complex was aflame \\nand it was clearly too little, too late; there were just two pumpers \\nand no water supply. The FBI made another call requesting a tank truck, \\nbut the Waco department apparently depended on hydrants and did not \\nhave one. Though clearly unwilling to risk firemen\\'s lives in the \\nline of fire, it seems they might have done so had there been sufficient \\nequipment and water to make a difference.\\n\\nThey even aired a tape of a woman who called Waco 911 from Georgia \\nasking if anything was being done. Civic-minded, but probably \\nirresponsible; if everyone watching television did that, no local \\ncalls could get through.\\n\\nABC also aired the comments of an independent fire investigator who \\nviewed tapes from more than one side of the compound (not just the \\nstandard \"pool shot\"), and agreed that the fire a) must have been \\nstarted in at least 3 places, and b) must have had an accelerant \\nto spread so fast.\\n\\nNeither of these is conclusive proof that the Koresh crowd offed \\nthemselves more than the FBI offed them, but it\\'s a heck of a lot \\nstronger proof than some of the \"theories\" floating around the net.\\n\\nScore 2 FBI, 0 Branch Davidians.

Back\\nthen, it was *all-out* war, and Germany and Japan had to be squashed.\\nAfter all, a million or more British had already died, hundreds of \\nthousands of French, a couple hundread thousand or so Americans, and \\nmillions of Russians, not to mention a few million Jews, Poles, and \\nother people of slavic descent in German concentration camps.

And it\\'s the people who suffer because of them.  All the more\\nreason to depose these \"entrenched political rulers operating in their\\nown selfish interests\"!  Or do you mean that this applies to the allies\\nas well??\\n\\n> \\n> Why all the fuss about Kuwait and not East Timor, Bosnia, or even Tibet?  If\\n> Iraq is so bad, why were we still selling them stuff a couple of weeks before\\n> we started bombing?\\n\\nI make no claim or effort to justify the misguided foreign policy of the\\nWest before the war.  It is evident that the West, especially America,\\nmisjudged Hussein drastically.  But once Hussein invaded Kuwait and \\nthreatened to militarily corner a significant portion of the world\\'s\\noil supply, he had to be stopped.  Sure the war could have been\\nprevented by judicious and concerted effort on the part of the West\\nbefore Hussein invaded Kuwait, but it is still *Hussein* who is\\nresponsible for his decision to invade.

I\\'ve\\ntried several combinations:\\n\\ncontroller - master - slave\\ncontroller - slave - master\\nmaster - controller - slave\\n\\nNone of them worked.  Unfortunately, I can\\'t think of any others.\\n\\nAnother possibility is that the 85MB one is already partitioned into\\ntwo seperate drives, C and D, and the CMOS asks for \"C: drive\" and \"D:\\ndrive\" setup info rather than \"drive 1\" and \"drive 2\" like most others\\nI\\'ve seen.

The drive came bereft of any docs, except for some\\ninfo for the CMOS setup; the controller has a little piece of paper\\nabout the size of an index card; I cannibalized the cable (it\\'s one\\nof those with a connector at each end and the one in the middle, so\\nit looks like a serial connection); now I be lost!\\n\\nMany, many thanks in advance!

Otherwise you\\'ll have\\n    to embed literal ESC and BEL characters in the string\\n    instead of using convenient octal sequences.]\\n\\n    If you want your titlebar updated continously, say to show\\n    your current directory, hostname, or somesuch, then you\\'ll\\n    have to see if you can coerce your shell into spitting out\\n    the appropriate escape sequences when it prompts for commands.\\n    Sometimes you can just put the appropriate escape sequence\\n    in the prompt string itself, sometimes not ...\\n\\n\\n+-------------------------------------------------------+------- /// -----+\\n| Mark Lanzo   KD4QLZ  lanzo@tekelec.com   919-460-5576 |    \\\\\\\\\\\\///       |\\n+-------------------------------------------------------+---- \\\\XX/ -------+\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n'),\n",

On April 19, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the\\nExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer\\n(MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received\\nproperly.\\n\\n2.  On April 19, a Command Detector Unit Signal-to-Noise Ratio (CDUSNR) test\\nand a Radio Frequency Subsystem Automatic Gain Control (RFSAGC) test were\\nperformed using the LGA-1 (Low Gain Antenna #1) over DSS-63 (Madrid 70 meter\\nantenna) and DSS-61 (Madrid 34 meter antenna), respectively.  Data analysis\\nis in process.  These tests are periodically performed to provide detailed\\ninformation relative to the telecom command hardware integrity.\\n\\n3.  On April 19, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to\\n264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.\\n\\n4.  On April 21, the first of two suppressed carrier/DSN (Deep Space Network)\\nadvanced receiver characterization tests was performed over DSS-14 (Goldstone\\n70 meter antenna).  The spacecraft modulation index was varied from 43 degrees\\nto 90 degrees for a range of ground receiver bandwidth settings.\\n\\n5.  The AC bus imbalance measurement has not exhibited significant change\\n(greater than 25 DN) throughout this period but the DC bus imbalance\\nmeasurement has.  The AC measurement reads 20 DN (4.5 volts).  The DC\\nmeasurement has ranged from 43 DN (4.6 volts) to 138 DN (16.2 volts) and\\ncurrently reads 138 DN (16.2 volts).  These measurements are consistent with\\nthe model developed by the AC/DC special anomaly team.\\n\\n6.  The Spacecraft status as of April 22, 1993, is as follows:\\n\\n       a)  System Power Margin -  68 watts\\n       b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin\\n       c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner\\n       d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 21 degrees\\n           off-sun (lagging) and 5 degrees off-earth (leading)\\n       e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1\\n       f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within\\n           acceptable range\\n       g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range\\n       h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,\\n           EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS\\n       i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within\\n           acceptable range\\n       j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours\\n           Time To Initiation - 184 hours\\n\\n\\nTRAJECTORY\\n\\n     As of noon Thursday, April 22, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory\\nstatus was as follows:\\n\\n\\tDistance from Earth         169,747,800 km (1.14 AU)\\n\\tDistance from Sun           286,967,900 km (1.92 AU)\\n\\tHeliocentric Speed          91,200 km per hour\\n\\tDistance from Jupiter       532,735,900 km\\n\\tRound Trip Light Time       18 minutes, 58 seconds\\n\\n\\nSPECIAL TOPIC\\n\\n1.  As of April 22, 1993, a total of 70185 real-time commands have been\\ntransmitted to Galileo since Launch.  Of these, 65077  were initiated in the\\nsequence design process and 5108 initiated in the real-time command process.\\nIn the past week, one real time command was transmitted: one was initiated in\\nthe sequence design process and none initiated in the real time command\\nprocess.

But kidney tissue may \\nbe too dense for ultrasound to work for kidney stones(any radiologists care \\nto comment?).\\n\\nMost stones will pass(but it\\'s a very painful process).  Unlike gallstones, \\nI don\\'t think that there are many drugs that can help \"dissolve\" the \\nkidney stone(which is probably calcium-oxalate).  Vitamin C and magnesium \\nhave worked in rabbits to remove calcium from calcified plaques in the \\naterial wall.  I have no idea if a diet change or supplementation could \\nspeed up the process of kidney stone passage(but I\\'m pretty confident that \\na diet change and/or supplementation can prevent a reoccurance).  If surgery \\nis being contemplated, the stone must be in the kidney tubule.  A second \\nopinion is a good idea because there are better(less damaging) ways to break \\nup the stone if it\\'s logged within the kidney(sonic blasts).  HMO\\'s are \\nnotorious for conservative care and long waits for expensvie treatments.  \\nMy condolences to your friend. \\n\\nMarty B.\\n'),\n",

What would the penalty if\\nyou were found out be?  What if you used said handgun in a defensive shooting\\nin your apartment there?  How would the city law apply to your impending \\ntrial for the shooting?\\nAlso, what is IL state law concerning short barreled weapons?

The transformer is just that - a \\ntransformer.  It\\'s there primarily to step the voltage up or down.  (Although\\nthe inductance seen by the switch transistor on the primary side is NOT\\nnegligible, as anyone who\\'s zapped said transistor from either failing to\\nget one with a high enough breakdown voltage or neglecting to include a\\n\"snubber\" diode across it would tell you.  Actually, many transistors intended\\nfor switcher use today have the diode built in.)\\n\\nThe basic switched-mode power supply operates something like this (in\\na somewhat simplified manner):  The AC line is rectified to produce a\\nhigh voltage, more-or-less unregulated DC rail.  The energy storage (or\\n\"filter\") caps appear across this rail, as does the switching transistor.\\nThe transistor chops the current into the primary side of the transformer,\\nresulting in stepped-up or stepped-down pulses out the secondary, which \\nare then rectified and filtered.  At least one of the transformer\\'s outputs\\nis sampled and fed back to the control circuit for the switching transistor,\\nwhich acts in a \"pulse-width modulation\" (PWM) fashion to control (by varying\\nthe pulse width) the amount of energy being dumped into the primary, and\\ntherefore the voltage coming out at the secondary.  The remaining outputs\\nmay be allowed to simply run at whatever value they will, more-or-less\\ntracking the regulated output, or they may have some additional linear\\nregulation added.  You may also note that the feedback between the \\nregulated output and the PWM control (which is most typically an IC)\\nis not done via a direct electrical connection; this is due to various\\nsafety standards which require primary and secondary circuits to be\\nelectrically isolated.  Often, the feedback path involves an optoisolator\\nto meet this requirement.\\n\\nWhile the transformer isn\\'t the primary energy-storage device in these\\ndesigns, this does not mean that the energy stored in the transformer can\\nbe ignored; besides the inductive \"kick\" giving the switch transistor a\\nbad time (as noted above), you also need to worry about getting all the\\nenergy that went *in* to the transformer back *out* again, one way or another.\\nIn some designs, this happens more or less automatically - but in others,\\nyou need to take special care to ensure that the transformer core doesn\\'t\\nsaturate, which again would have disastrous results (best left to the \\nimagination! :-)).\\n\\nI\\'m NOT by any stretch of the imagination a power-supply designer; \\nhopefully, a real one will come along soon and clean up any gross errors\\nin the above.\\n\\n\\nBob Myers  KC0EW   Hewlett-Packard Co.      |Opinions expressed here are not\\n                   Systems Technology Div.  |those of my employer or any other\\nmyers@fc.hp.com    Fort Collins, Colorado   |sentient life-form on this planet.\\n'),\n",

Blackman, Research Coordinator for\\nNRA-ILA. NRA Official Journal 1/89.\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDear sir:\\n\\nBy now, we are used to the New England Journal of Medicine\\'s publication\\nof small-scale studies related to firearms from which conclusions are\\ndrawn which are quantum leaps from the data, followed by announcements of \\nmomentus \"scientific\" findings. These are regularly released to the press\\nwithout the caveats which riddle the conclusory paragraphs, and\\noften accompanied by an editorial calling attention to the findings.\\nGenerally, while they at least present a few interesting data, however\\nmeaningless, the studies misinterpret statistics, and ignore or belittle\\nserious studies by criminologists.\\n\\nThe latest effort -- \"Handgun Regulations, Crime, Assaults, and Homicide:\\nA Tale of Two Cities,\" by J.H. Sloan, et al., with the accompanying \\neditorial, \"Firearms Injuries: A Call for Science,\" by two employees\\nof the Centers for Disease Control (November 10), however, is an insult\\nto the intelligence of any serious scholar in any field and have so few\\ndata and so many flaws that I feel compelled to write at some length\\nto call attention to various major and minor failings, in no particular\\norder.\\n\\n\\t1. The authors misleadingly cite Wright, et al. (Ref. 1) to \\n\\tsupport the statement that \"some have argued that restricting\\n\\taccess to handguns could substantially reduce our annual rate\\n\\tof homicide.\" Wright, et al., in fact studied and rejected that\\n\\tcontention.\\n\\t\\n\\t2. The authors pretended that Vancouver and Seattle are very\\n\\tsimilar cities with similar economic circumstances, histories,\\n\\tdemographic characteristics, and the like. In fact, the cities\\n\\tare very different with very different demographic characteristics\\n\\twhich appear to explain completely the higher homicide rate in\\n\\tSeattle. Both cities are over three-forths non-Hispanic white\\n\\tand *the non-Hispanic white homicide rates are reported to be\\n\\tthe same in Seattle and Vancouver*. It is the different back-\\n\\tgrounds, problems, circumstances, and behaviors of the various\\n\\tethnic minorities which explain the difference in homicide.\\n\\t\\n\\t3. The authors pretend they are evaluating Canada\\'s gun law,\\n\\tcompared to Washington State\\'s. But they do not examine at all\\n\\tthe situation in Vancouver prior to the gun law taking effect\\n\\tin 1978. As it happens, in the three years prior to that (1975-\\n\\t1977), Vancouver averaged 23 homicides per year, one-eighth\\n\\tinvolving handguns, (Ref. 2) and in the seven years of the NEJM\\n\\tarticle there were 29 homicides per year, one-eigth involving\\n\\thandguns. Surely even the medical profession recognizes that\\n\\tone must look to see the prior situation was before concluding\\n\\tthat a change made a difference? Would a physician conclude that\\n\\ta patient was benefiting from eating oat bran muffin each day\\n\\tfor seven years because his cholesterol level was 200 without\\n\\tat least seeing if it was 180 before he started the regimen?\\n\\t\\n\\t4. The authors pick two medium-sized cities to evaluate a national\\n\\tgun law. Nothing can be learned from such a tiny and arbitrarily\\n\\tselected sample. Seattle appears to have been selected because\\n\\tit was convienient for the authors rather than for any scientific\\n\\treason. Would physicians call something a scientific study which\\n\\tinvolved one experimental subject and one dissimilar \"control\"?\\n\\tHad different arbitrarily selected cities been chosen, opposite\\n\\t\"scientific\" conclusions would follow: Vancouver\\'s homicide\\n\\trate *exceeds* that of such \"wild west\" cities in Texas as\\n\\tEl Paso, Corpus Christi, Austen, and, in Colorado, Colorado\\n\\tSprings. (Ref. 3)\\n\\t\\n\\t5. The authors fail to clearly demonstrate that firearms or\\n\\thandguns \"are far more commonly owned in Seattle than in\\n\\tVancouver.\" They use two surrogate approaches in pretending\\n\\tto study the availability of firearms/handguns. The first is\\n\\tan apples-and-oranges effort to compare the number of carry\\n\\tpermits in Seattle to the number of registered handguns in\\n\\tVancouver. But the number clearly understates the number of\\n\\thandguns in Seattle, and counts primarily *protective* handgun\\n\\towners. The second, however, tells nothing about the number\\n\\tof handguns in Vancouver, and counts *non-protective* handguns\\n\\tfor the most part. Where is it difficult to obtain handguns\\n\\tlegally for protection, registration figures are\\n\\tmeaningless. There are 66,000 registered handguns in New York\\n\\tCity (New York Daily News, Sept. 27, 1987). Comparing the two,\\n\\tthat method suggests about 930 handguns per 100,000 population\\n\\tin New York City compared to 960 in Vancouver, meaning Vancouver\\n\\thas a greater \"prevalence of weapons\" than New York City.\\n\\t\\n\\tThe second method of measuring gun density is \"Cook\\'s gun\\n\\tprevalence index, a previously validated measure of intercity\\n\\tdifferences.\" But the validation was by Cook of his own\\n\\ttheory. (Ref. 4) Normally, second opinions are sought from a\\n\\tdifferent doctor. More significantly, the Cook index is\\n\\tbased on the average of the percentage of firearms involvement\\n\\tin suicide and homicide. So the authors are basically taking\\n\\ta measure of misuse. Unsurprisingly, gun misuse in homicide\\n\\t(42% in Seattle, 14% in Vancouver) is related to gun misuse in\\n\\thomicide plus suicide, divided by two (41% in Seattle, 12% in\\n\\tVancouver). The authors are not measuring the relative avail-\\n\\tability of firearms, or of handguns, in Seattle and\\n\\tVancouver.\\n\\t\\n\\t6. The authors misstate the laws of both Washington and\\n\\tCanada. They neglect to mention the significant fact that\\n\\tWashington has a waiting period and background check prior to\\n\\tthe purchase of a handgun, and that provisions exist in Canadian\\n\\tlaw for owning and carrying handguns for personal\\n\\tprotection. The authors also make it appear that it is more\\n\\tdifficult to get a handgun legally in Canada than is actually\\n\\tthe case.\\n\\t\\n\\t7. The authors ignore all other factors which might explain\\n\\tthe differences in crime rate, beyond some vague mention of the\\n\\tpenalities provided by law and the roughest of estimates of \\n\\tclearence for one particular offense -- homicide involving a\\n\\tfirearm. There is no measure of: the differences in the number\\n\\tof law enforcement officers; their aggressiveness in making\\n\\tarrests for gun law violations in the two jurisdictions; arrest\\n\\trates for other offenses; conviction rates; actual sentences\\n\\timposed for gun-related crimes, violent crimes without guns,\\n\\tor gun law violations; or incarceration rates. Whereas social\\n\\tscientists would attempt to measure and hold for such differences,\\n\\tthe authors of the NEJM \"tale of two cities\" fail even to mention\\n\\tmost factors related to crime control.\\n\\t\\n\\t8. The authors dismiss claims that handguns are an effective\\n\\tmeans for protection unless the criminal is killed. Such is not\\n\\tthe case. Criminologists (Ref. 5-8) have found that almost\\n\\t650,000 Americans annually use handguns for protection from\\n\\tcriminals, and that using a gun for protection reduces the\\n\\tliklihood that a crime -- rape, robbery, assault -- will be\\n\\tcompleted by the criminal and reduces the likelihood of injury\\n\\tto the victim. It is interesting, nonetheless, that the authors\\n\\treported the same number (four) of civilian justifiable homicides\\n\\twithout firearms in each city but that less restrictive Seattle\\n\\taccounted for 100% of the reported civilian justifiable homicides\\n\\tinvolving firearms.\\n\\t\\n\\t9. The Centers for Disease Control, which funded the \"study,\"\\n\\teditorially praised the paper, (Ref. 9) saying it \"applied\\n\\tscientific methods to examine a focus of contention betweeb\\n\\tadvocates of stricter regulation of firearms, particularly\\n\\thandguns.\" There is nothing in the paper which could possibly\\n\\tbe mistaken for \"scientific methods\" by a sociologists or\\n\\tcriminologists. The Vancouver-Seattle \"study\" is the equivolent\\n\\tof testing an experimental drug to control hypertension by finding\\n\\ttwo ordinary-looking middle-class white males, one aged 25\\n\\tand the other 40, and without first taking their vital signs,\\n\\tadministering the experimental drug to the 25-year-old while\\n\\tgiving the 40-year-old a placebo, then taking their blood pressure\\n\\tand, on finding the younger man had a lower blood pressure, \\n\\tannouncing in a \"special article\" a new medical breakthrough.\\n\\tIt would be nice to think that such a \"study\" would neither be\\n\\tfunded by the CDC or printed by the NEJM.\\n\\t\\n\\tSince the longstanding anti-gun biases of the NEJM and the CDC\\n\\tmake them willing to present shoddy research as \"scientific\\n\\tbreakthroughs\" in \"special articles\" and editorials relating\\n\\tto firearms, we are obligated to correct the record by notifying\\n\\tthe news media and those with congressional and executive oversight\\n\\tover the activities of the Centers for Disease Control about\\n\\tthe distortions contained in \"Handgun Regulations, Crime, Assaults,\\n\\tand Homicides: A Tale of Two Cities\" and \"Firearm Injuries: A Call\\n\\tfor Science.\" Clearly, all scientific standards go by the wayside\\n\\twhenever the CDC and the New England Journal of Medicine seize\\n\\tan opportunity to attack firearms ownership in America.\\n\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tREFERENCES\\n\\n1.

Wright\\n          (from July 1989 issue of REASON, Free Minds & Free Markets)\\n\\n      Someone once wrote: \"Statistics are like a bikini.  What they real is\\n   suggestive, but what they conceal is vital.\"  The problem is demonstrated\\n   by the most recent entry in a long line of scientific research purporting\\n   to show a causal link between gun availability and homicide.  Funded by\\n   the federal government and published last year in the New England Journal\\n   of Medicine, the study compared homicide rates in Seattle and Vancouver and\\n   suggested that a handgun ban \"may reduce the rate of homicide in a \\n   community.\"\\n      The nine medical doctors who published \"Handgun Regulations, Crime,\\n   Assaults, and Homicide\" essentially reasoned in three steps: (1) Despite\\n   many historical, social, and demographic similarities, (2) Vancouver\\n   has a markedly lower homicide rate (3) because its stricter gun regulations\\n   make guns less available.  The second step in their reasoning seems\\n   indisputable.  The overall homicide rate in Seattle (for the period\\n   1980-86) was 11.3 per 100,000 popuation, compared with 6.9 in Vancouver.\\n   Homicide is definitely more common in Seattle.  The question then becomes,\\n   Why?\\n      The authors present a believable although not entirely accurate case\\n   to support the notion, as claimed in the third step of their reasoning,\\n   that Vancouver\\'s handgun regulations are much more stringent.  But their\\n   evidence on the difference in gun *availabilty* is indirect and \\n   unpersuasive; indeed, they acknowledge that direct evidence on the point\\n   does not exist.  They offer two fragments of inferential data in support\\n   of the claim that guns are more available in Seattle; but for all anybody\\n   knows as a matter of empirical fact, the opposite could be true.  We\\n   are therefore being asked, at the conclusion of the study, to believe that\\n   a difference in gun availability explains the difference in homicide rates\\n   when a difference in gun availability has not itself been established.\\n      Indeed, the situation is even more troublesome.  The first of the two\\n   indirect bits of evidence is a difference between the number of concealed-\\n   weapons permits issued in Seattle and the number of restricted-weapons\\n   permits issued in Vancouver.  Differences between the two cities in the\\n   permit regulations render these two numbers strictly noncomparable.\\n*     The second bit of evidence is \"Cook\\'s gun prevalence index,\" which stands\\n*  at 41 percent for Seattle but only 12 percent for Vancouver.  Cook\\'s index\\n*  however, does not measure the relative prevalence of gun ownership in \\n*  various cities.  It measures gun misuse--it is an average of the percentage\\n*  of homicides and suicides involving firearms.\\n*     In the present case, the index shows only that in homicides and suicides,\\n*  firearms are more likely to be used in Seatte than in Vancouver.  To take\\n*  Cook\\'s index as a measure of general firearms availability, it must be\\n*  assumed that the proportional involvement of guns in homicides and suicides\\n*  is directly related to their relative availability in the general \\n*  population.  But this is exactly what the authors are seeking to prove. To\\n*  assume what one is seeking to prove, then to \"prove\" it on the basis of\\n*  that assumption does ot constitute scientific evidence for anything.\\n      Even if we were to grant, on the basis of no compelling evidence, that\\n   guns are less common in Vancouver, we might still question what causes what.\\n   The authors attribute Seattle\\'s higher crime rate to a higher rate of gun\\n   ownership.  But it might well be argued that low crime or homicide rates\\n   reduce the motivation for average citizens to obtain guns--in other words,\\n   that crime rates explain the variation in gun ownership, not vice versa.\\n      In fact, it was once commonly argued that Great Britain\\'s low rate of\\n   violent crime was a function of that nation\\'s strict gun laws and the \\n   consequent low rate of gun ownership--until British researcher Colin \\n   Greenwood found that Great Britain had enjoyed low rates of violent crime\\n   for many decades before strict firearms controls were enacted.  To invoke\\n   an ancient methodological saw, correlation is not cause.\\n      Nor do the problems with this study end with its lack of direct data\\n   on gun ownership.  The authors say Seattle and Vancouver are \"similar in\\n   many ways,\" implying that they differ mainly in gun availability, gun-law\\n   stringency, and crime rates.  This is an evident attempt to establish\\n   the ceteris paribus condition of a sound scientific analysis--that \"all\\n   else is equal\" among things being compared.\\n*     Clearly the two cities are similar in some ways, but a closer look \\n*  reveals differences in ways that are relevant to their respective crime\\n*  or homicide rates.  The cities are closely matched in what percentage\\n*  of their population is white (79 percent and 76 percent).  But Seattle\\n*  is about 10 percent black, while Vancouver is less than 0.5 percent.\\n*  Vancouver\\'s minority population is overwhelmingly Asian.  So although the\\n*  authors show that th two cities are approximately comparable on a half-\\n*  dozen readily available demographic indicators, they have not shown\\n*  that all potentially relevant sources of variation have been ruled out.\\n*     In fact, the differences in racial compositions of the two cities is\\n*  particularly relevant in light of the study\\'s breakdown of homicide rates\\n*  according to the race of the victim.  For the white majority, the homicide\\n*  rates are nearly identical--6.2 per 100,000 in Seattle, 6.4 in Vancouver.\\n*  The differing overall homicide rates in the two cities are therefore due\\n*  entirely to vastly different rates among racial minorities.  For blacks,\\n*  the observed difference in homicide rate is 36.6 to 9.5 and for Hispanics\\n*  26.9 to 7.9.  (Methodoligical complexities render the Asian comparison\\n*  problematic, but it too is higher in Seattle than in Vancouver.)  Racial\\n*  minorities are much more likely to be the victims of homicide in Seattle\\n*  than in Vancouver; the white majority is equally likely to be slain\\n*  in either city.\\n      Since the nearly 2:1 initial difference in homicide reates between the\\n   cities is due exclusively to 3:1 or 4:1 differences between minority \\n   groups, it is fair to ask why postulated difference in \"gun availability\"\\n   (or gun-law strigency) would matter so dramatically to minorities but not\\n   matter at all to whites.  Can differential gun availability explain why\\n   blacks and Hispanics--but not whites--are so much more likely to be killed\\n   in Seattle than in Vancouver?  (Studies in the United States, incidentally,\\n   do not show large or consistent racial differences in gun ownership.)\\n      Or are other explanations more plausible?  Could the disparity between\\n   Canadian and American rates of poverty among racial minorities have \\n   anything to do with it?  What are the relative rates of drug or alcohol \\n   abuse?  Of homelessness among each cty\\'s minority population?  (The city\\n   of Seattle runs the largest shelter for homeless men west of the \\n   Mississippi.)  Unemployment among young, central-city, nonwhite men in the\\n   United States usually exceeds 40 percent.  What is the comparable Canadian\\n   percentage?\\n      The crucial point is that Canada and the United States differ in many\\n   ways, as do cities and population subgroups with the two countries.  Absent\\n   more detailed analysis, nearly any of these \"many ways\" might explain part\\n   or all of the difference in homicide rates.  In gross comparisons such\\n   as those between Seattle and Vancouver, all else is *not* equal.\\n*     The authors of this study acknowledge that racial patterns in homicide\\n*  result in a \"complex picture.\"  They do not acknowledge that the ensuing\\n*  complexities seriously undercut the main thrust of their argument.  They\\n*  also acknowledge that \"socio-economic status is probably an important\\n*  confounding factor in our comparison,\" remarking further that \"blacks   \\n*  in Vancouver had a slightly higher mean income in 1981 than the rest of\\n*  Vancouver\\'s population.\"  Given the evidence presented in the article,\\n*  it is possible that all of the difference in homicide rates between Seattle\\n*  and Vancouver results from greater proverty among Seattle\\'s racial\\n*  minorities.  But the authors pay no further attention to this possibility,\\n*  since \"detailed information about household incomes according to race\\n*  is not available for Vancouver.\"\\n      The largely insurmountable methodological difficulties confronted in \\n   gross comparative studies of this sort can be illustrated with as simple\\n   example.  If one were to take all U.S. couties and compare them in terms\\n   of (1) pervalence of gun ownership and (2) crime or homicide rates, one \\n   would find an astonishing pattern: Counties with more guns have less crime.\\n   Would one conclude from this evidence alone that guns actually reduce \\n   crime?  Or would one insist that other variables also be taken into\\n   account?  In this example, the \"hidden variable\" is city size: Guns are\\n   more common in small towns and rural areas, whereas crime is a big-city\\n   problem.  If researchers failed to anticipate this variable, or lacked the\\n   appropriate data to examine its possible consequences, they coud be very\\n   seriously misled.  In the study at hand, the authors matched two cities\\n   for size but not for minority poverty rates or other hidden variables,\\n   and their results are impossible to interpret.\\n      In the editorial \"Firearm Injuries: A Call for Science\" accompanying\\n   the study, two officials from the Centers for Disease Control lauded the\\n   authors for applying \"scientific methods\" to a problem of grave public\\n   heath significance.  But in attempting to draw causal conclusions from\\n   nonexperimental research, the essence of scientific method is to anticipate\\n   plausible alternative explanations for the results and try to rule them\\n   out.  Absent such effort, the results may well seem scientific but are\\n   little more than polemics masquerading as serious research.  That this\\n   study is but one of a number of recent efforts--all employing practical\\n   identical research designs and published in leading scientific journals--\\n   is cause for further concern.\\n\\n   [James D.

In fact,\\n>it doesn\\'t mean *anything*, because the units are screwy.\\n\\nI agree and disagree.  John is saying that the batters efforts will result\\nin 4 more wins then losses.  While you are probably correct that 400%\\ndoes not mean 4 more wins then losses, it means something.  I would\\nrather have a player who increased my teams chances of winning by 1% in\\neach of 400 PAs then I would a player who increased my chances of winning\\nby .5% in each of 400 PAs.  Thus, there appears to me to be an obvious\\npositive association between John\\'s statistic and winning games.  Thus,\\nbefore you disregard this stat, it appears to me that further study must\\ngo into what sort of relationship there is.\\n\\n>Consider an example:  Bob hits a 2-out solo HR in the bottom of the first;\\n>about .12 on your scale.  He does the same thing again in the fourth, with\\n>the score tied, for another .14.  And again, in the seventh, with the score\\n>tied, for another .22.  And, finally, in the ninth to win the game by a score\\n>of 7-6, for a value of 0.5.  Bob hit 4 solo HR in 4 plate appearances, and\\n>was credited by your method with .12 + .14 + .22 + .5 = .98.  But what does\\n>that mean?  Was Bob 98% responsible for the win?  Certainly not; the defense\\n>is *always* 50% responsible (if you include pitching in that), and Bob wasn\\'t\\n>pitching.  In fact, Bob was only 4/7 of the offense (which is a lot, but not\\n>even close to 100%).  Furthermore, what about the other 3 team runs?  Say\\n>they all came on solo HR by Fred; then Fred was hitting HR to tie up the game,\\n>which are just as valuable as HR to take the lead (see Lindsey), and Fred will\\n>himself have accrued a good .4 rating or so.  So Fred and Bob combined have\\n>amassed 138% of a win IN ONE GAME.  There\\'s clearly a problem here.\\n\\nThe only problem here is an insistance that these number mean exactly\\nhow many wins the team has.  First, we are using averages over many\\nseasons and applying them to one game.  Second, remember some players\\nperformance take away from the chance of you winning.  That is a\\nplayer who gets an out gets a \"negative probability\" in most cases.\\nThus, I\\'m not sure in any given game when you add up all the numbers\\nfor a team who won that they will add up to 1 in that game.  Sometimes,\\nthey will add up to more then one sometime, less than one.  Also,\\nthe pitchers\\' bad performances (giving up 6 runs) may have given\\nthem a large negative percentage for that game.  Also, any batter that\\npulled an 0-4 night would give large negatives.  \\n\\n\\n\\n>>Greg thinking about the right things, but his intuition is off the\\n>>mark.  Closers are enormously important.  The total number of runs\\n>>value is outweighed by when they come, or are prevented from comming.\\n>>The doubling which Greg allows is not enough.\\n>\\n>In another article, I proposed a test of this.  We can predict a team\\'s \\n>won/lost record quite accurately by looking at how many runs *total* they\\n>score and allow, without regard to when those runs score in the game.  If\\n>late runs are really more important than early runs, then looking only at\\n>late runs should lead to a *better* predictor, right?\\n\\nNo, but really only because you have a smaller sample size.  I would\\nthink however, that the number of runs you score in the first inning\\nwould be just as good as a prediction as how many runs you score \\nin the last inning.  And, realize something else a closer usually\\ncomes in in a close situation, not a blow out.  It is hard to argue\\nthat any runs that a closer gives up in a game have equal importance\\nto those given up in the first inning.  Look, a closer giving up runs\\noften means a team will lose many games.  On, the other hand a starter\\nwho gives up runs often still leaves his team a chance to win.  The\\noffence has many more outs to do something about.  But, I am not\\nsaying all late inning situations are equally important either.  If\\nI am down 8 runs in the ninth, it really does not matter how many\\nruns my pitcher gives up in the ninth.       \\n\\n>Here\\'s another thought experiment: apply this method to basketball.  What\\n>you find is that points scored in the first *half* of the game have almost\\n>exactly no value, because no lead is safe with an entire half yet to play.\\n>Furthermore, the sub in off the bench who sinks the winning free throws with\\n>no time on the clock gets a +1.0 for the game, while the star forward who \\n>scored 27 points in the first half before spraining his ankle gets a zero.\\n>\\n>Does this make sense?\\n\\n\\nNo, but why would you assume that the teams probability of winning would\\nbe 0 before the possesion in which the free throws were made.  Look,\\nif you are down 1 point with 5 seconds left, there is a fairly high\\nprobability that you will win the game if you are in possesion of the\\nball.  And, do not forget that somebody elses missed shots, turnovers,\\nfouls, bad defense, etc. caused a \"negative chance\" that the team\\nwould win.\\n \\nFrom reading all of the discussion on this statistic, I feel that those\\nwho critisize it to a certain extent are doing so out of an agenda.\\nAt first look this statistic valadates clutchness.  But, it really\\ndoes not.  Cluthness revolves around the idea that certain players\\nin crucial situation elevate their performance and others performance\\ngoes down.  I\\'ve never seen convincing proof that this really happens.\\nSo, if you assume there is no clutchness, then that means that except\\nfor a lot of noice, this statistic has a positive association to\\nplayer performance.  There is a way to get rid of the noice if you\\ndo not believe in clutchness.  Certainly, we could find out what\\nthe average value of a home run is for example.  We may find for\\ninstance, that a home run increases your chance of winning by 15%\\non average while a strikeout decreases your chance of winning by 5%.\\nI bet if this were done we would find that this statistic was just\\nas good as other statistics we have for predicting wins and losses.\\n\\nHow do we evaluate relief pitchers?  Say John and Sam have the\\nexact same pitching statistics (runs, earned runs, K\\'s, BB\\'s,\\netc.)  Both had exceptional numbers.  John, however only pitched\\nin closer situations, while Sam was a Mop up man.  Who was more\\nvaluble to their team?  Probably John.  Who was the better \\npitcher?  They were probably about the same.\\n\\n                                                        Brian Smith\\n'),\n",

She said even common ear infections frequently seen in\\nchildren are becoming resistant to antibiotic treatment.\\n\\n\"Despite predictions earlier this century that infectious  diseases\\nwould soon be eliminated as a public health problem, infectious diseases\\nremain the major cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of illness\\nand death in the United States,\" the CDC said.\\n\\nIt  cited  the  emergence since the 1970s of a \"myriad\" of newly\\nidentified pathogens and syndromes, such as Escherichia coli O157:H7, a\\ndeadly bacterial infection; the hepatitis C virus; HIV, the virus that\\ncauses AIDS; Legionnaires disease; Lyme disease; and toxic shock syndrome.\\n\\n\"The incidences of many diseases widely presumed to be under control,\\nsuch as cholera, malaria and tuberculosis, have increased in many areas,\"\\nthe CDC said.  It said efforts at control and prevention have been\\nundermined by drug resistance.\\n\\n=====*=====\\n\\nSOURCE:  WALL STREET JOURNAL\\nREFERENCE: 04/15/93, pB1\\nHEADLINE: Lyme-Disease Ruling Raises Liability Issues\\n\\nThe tick that causes Lyme disease may have found a new way to cause\\ndamage: legal liability.\\n\\nA federal judge\\'s decision holding a property owner liable for not\\ndoing enough to protect workers from Lyme disease is getting as much\\nattention as the latest medical study on the disease, a flu-like\\nillness that can cause severe physical and mental disabilities and in\\nrare instances death. The decision last week has put property owners\\non notice that they may have to do more than protect themselves from\\nthe ticks-they also may have to protect themselves from litigation if\\nsomeone becomes infected while on the property.\\n\\nThe decision by U.S. District Judge Robert J. Ward in New York came\\nafter a week-long trial in a case involving four track workers for the\\nLong Island Railroad. Judge Ward found that the workers contracted the\\ndisease after they were bitten by ticks while on the job. He ordered\\nthe New York state-owned commuter line to pay the workers more than\\n$560,000 to compensate for pain and suffering, in addition to medical\\nexpenses and lost wages.\\n\\nSummer camps, schools, companies with facilities in rural or\\nsemirural areas, and homeowners who rent to vacationers are among the\\ngroups that need to be worried about this ruling, says Stephen L.\\nKass, an attorney at New York law firm Berle, Kass & Case, who wrote a\\nlegal article three years ago warning property owners of the potential\\nliability. Even a family that invites friends over for a backyard\\nbarbecue might be potentially liable.\\n\\nLawsuits for insect bites, while rare, aren\\'t unheard-of. A summer\\nvacationer in Southampton, N.Y., last year sued the owner of the home\\nshe rented, claiming that a tick on the property gave her Rocky\\nMountain spotted fever. In 1988, also on Long Island, a jury ordered\\nan outdoor restaurant to pay more than $3 million to a patron who was\\nstung by a bee, causing an allergic reaction and permanent\\nquadriplegia. The judge later threw out the award, citing no evidence\\nthat a beehive was near the restaurant.\\n\\nBut lawyers say that the attention to Lyme disease throughout the\\ncountry -- it\\'s most prevalent in New England, the Middle Atlantic\\nstates, Wisconsin, Minnesota and the Northwest -- may make this\\nparticular insect bite a particularly litigious one.\\n\\nThe illness already has proved to be a source of controversy in the\\ncourtroom over such issues as the type of medical care insurers will\\ncover and medical malpractice claims against doctors for not\\ndiagnosing the disease.\\n\\nLawyers say worker\\'s-compensation claims related to Lyme disease\\nhave become common in some states in recent years. Payments in\\nworker\\'s-compensation cases, however, are limited to medical costs and\\nlost earnings.\\n\\nThe case before Judge Ward dealt with a potentially much more\\nlucrative avenue for damages, because it involved the question of\\nnegligence. Unlike the worker\\'s compensation process, the law governing\\ninjuries to rail workers allows for a finding of negligence and, as a\\nresult, for additional payments for pain and suffering. Property\\nowners and lawyers say that negligence claims can be made in many\\nother situations where people are exposed to the ticks that carry the\\ndisease.\\n\\nIra M. Maurer, a partner at New York law firm Elkind, Flynn &\\nMaurer, who represented the rail workers, says the decision will help\\nto establish \"the duty of all sorts of property owners to protect\\nagainst Lyme disease.\"\\n\\nLawyers caution that despite Judge Ward\\'s decision, winning a\\nlawsuit for damages caused by Lyme disease may prove difficult. For\\none thing, victims have to demonstrate that they have pinned down when\\nand where they got the tick bite. Judge Ward found that the plaintiffs\\nin the railroad case got Lyme disease while working on property owned\\nby the railroad, even though none of the men remembered being bitten.\\nThe workers, who weren\\'t outdoorsmen likely to be exposed elsewhere to\\nthe insects, said they saw ticks in the high grass that surrounded\\nsome work sites.\\n\\nA spokeswoman for the railroad says that there was no proof that\\nthe four men were bitten while on the job and that the railroad is\\nconsidering an appeal. The railroad also disputes Judge Ward\\'s finding\\nthat it didn\\'t do enough to protect employees. The spokeswoman says\\nthe railroad provides track workers with insect repellent and special\\npants to protect against bug bites.\\n\\nDebate in the scientific community over Lyme disease could open up\\nsome legal defenses for property owners, such as questioning whether a\\nvictim actually has the disease rather than some other illness.\\nEarlier this week, the Journal of the American Medical Association\\nreported that doctors overly diagnose patients as having Lyme disease.\\nAnd damages awarded to a victim also might be influenced by medical\\ndisputes over the degree of harm that Lyme disease causes.\\n\\nBecause of health and safety concerns, some groups and companies\\nalready take special measures to protect against Lyme disease. Last\\nyear, at its headquarters in Franklin Lakes, N.J., Becton, Dickinson &\\nCo. began using Damminix, a pesticide made by EcoHealth Inc. of Boston\\nthat is designed to kill ticks carrying the disease. The medical-\\nsupply company\\'s headquarters include a 120-acre park, and the company\\nwas worried that employees who walk on its trails for recreation might\\nget infected.\\n\\nRuth Lister, a spokeswoman for the American Camping Association in\\nIndianapolis, says that many youth camps accredited by her\\norganization also have begun to check children for ticks. And Carole\\nKatz, a member of the board of the Fire Island Pines Property Owners\\nAssociation, says her group spends $30,000 each year to treat their\\n100-acre site off the coast of New York with the tick-killing\\npesticide.\\n\\n=====*=====\\n\\nTITLE: Urinary dysfunction in Lyme disease.\\nAUTHORS: Chancellor MB; McGinnis DE; Shenot PJ; Kiilholma P; Hirsch IH,\\nDepartment of Urology, Jefferson Medical College, Thomas Jefferson\\nUniversity, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\\nREFERENCE: J Urol 1993 Jan; 149 (1): 26-30\\n\\nLyme disease, which is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, is\\nassociated with a variety of neurological sequelae.  We describe 7 patients\\nwith neuro-borreliosis who also had lower urinary tract dysfunction.\\nUrodynamic evaluation revealed detrusor hyperreflexia in 5 patients and\\ndetrusor areflexia in 2.  Detrusor external sphincter dyssynergia was not\\nnoted on electromyography in any patient.  We observed that the urinary tract\\nmay be involved in 2 respects in the course of Lyme  disease: 1) voiding\\ndysfunction may be part of neuro-borreliosis and 2) the spirochete may\\ndirectly invade the urinary tract.  In 1 patient bladder infection by the\\nLyme spirochete was documented on biopsy.  Neurological and urological\\nsymptoms in all patients were slow to resolve and convalescence was\\nprotracted.  Relapses of active Lyme disease and residual neurological\\ndeficits were common.  Urologists practicing in areas endemic for Lyme\\ndisease need to be aware of B. burgdorferi infection in the differential\\ndiagnosis of neurogenic bladder dysfunction.  Conservative bladder\\nmanagement including clean intermittent catheterization guided by urodynamic\\nevaluation is recommended.\\n\\n\\nIV. ***** QUESTIONS \\'N\\' ANSWERS *****\\n\\nNote: If you have a response to this question, please forward it to the\\neditor.\\n\\nSender: Terry Morse <morset@ccmail.orst.edu>\\nSubject: Question on Lyme Vectors and Compost Piles\\n\\n  When I visited my sister on Long Island, NY, I was cautioned to avoid the\\ncompost heap in her back yard, as she thinks this is where she became\\ninfected.\\n\\n  A friend of mine here in Oregon who has a compost heap would like me to\\nback that claim up with documentation.

JPEG is designed for compressing either\\nfull-color or gray-scale digital images of \"natural\", real-world scenes.\\nIt does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line\\ndrawings.\\n\\nJPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it\\nhandle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types\\nof images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG\\nrespectively.\\n\\nJPEG is \"lossy\", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn\\'t\\nquite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much\\nof its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably\\nthe fact that small color details aren\\'t perceived as well as small details\\nof light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will\\nbe looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the\\nsmall errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are\\ninvisible to the eye.\\n\\nA useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by\\nadjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade\\noff file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small\\nfiles if you don\\'t mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image\\narchives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you\\naren\\'t happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you\\ncan jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.\\n\\n\\n[2]  Why use JPEG?\\n\\nThere are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store\\n24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.\\n\\nMaking image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across\\nnetworks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a\\n2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in\\ndisk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the\\nsize ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)\\n\\nIf your viewing software doesn\\'t support JPEG directly, you\\'ll have to\\nconvert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even\\nwith a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image\\nthan to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using\\nJPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to\\nstore or transmit an image more cheaply.\\n\\nIt\\'s worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the\\ntime savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the\\nextra time to decompress the file.  I\\'ll let you do the arithmetic yourself.\\n\\nThe other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet\\nposting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel\\n(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have\\nonly 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage\\nto you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as\\nblack-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed\\nin section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among\\npeople with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably\\nmore appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.\\n\\n\\n[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?\\n\\nJPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,\\nGIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first\\nthings to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.\\n\\nAs a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or\\ngray-scale images of \"realistic\" scenes; that means scanned photographs and\\nsimilar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don\\'t have 24-bit display\\nhardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)\\n\\nGIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,\\nsuch as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels\\nthat are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed\\nby GIF.  JPEG can\\'t squeeze these files as much as GIF does without\\nintroducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.\\n(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they\\nshould be avoided in JPEG files.)\\n\\nJPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels\\nadjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to\\ncome out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this\\nsort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly\\noften in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is\\nparticularly objectionable with text that\\'s only a few pixels high.\\nIf you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don\\'t JPEG it.\\n\\nComputer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between\\nscanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and\\nsubtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.\\nThe same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).\\n\\nPlain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.\\nYou need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale\\nimages.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images\\nof up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.\\n\\nIf you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you\\nshould convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.\\n(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only\\napplies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from\\na GIF, you\\'ve already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG\\ncan only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify\\nconverting anyway.  This is a decision you\\'ll have to make for yourself.\\nIf you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be\\nprepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not\\nconvert well.\\n\\n\\n[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?\\n\\nPretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have\\nhandy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three\\nfiles are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG\\nsoftware described in section 6B.\\n\\nFile\\t   Size in bytes\\t\\tComments\\n\\nship.ppm\\t1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits\\n\\t\\t\\t or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)\\nship.ppm.Z\\t 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress\\n\\t\\t\\t compress doesn\\'t accomplish a lot, you\\'ll note.\\n\\t\\t\\t Other text-oriented compressors give similar results.\\nship.gif\\t 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif\\n\\t\\t\\t Most of the savings is the result of losing color\\n\\t\\t\\t info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)\\n\\nship.jpg95\\t 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)\\n\\t\\t\\t This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,\\n\\t\\t\\t at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.\\nship.jpg75\\t  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)\\n\\t\\t\\t You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this\\n\\t\\t\\t from the original, even with both on-screen at once.\\nship.jpg50\\t  38406  cjpeg -Q 50\\n\\t\\t\\t This has slight defects; if you know what to look\\n\\t\\t\\t for, you could tell it\\'s been JPEGed without seeing\\n\\t\\t\\t the original.  Still as good image quality as many\\n\\t\\t\\t recent postings in Usenet pictures groups.\\nship.jpg25\\t  25192  cjpeg -Q 25\\n\\t\\t\\t JPEG\\'s characteristic \"blockiness\" becomes apparent\\n\\t\\t\\t at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).\\n\\t\\t\\t Still, I\\'ve seen plenty of Usenet postings that were\\n\\t\\t\\t of poorer image quality than this.\\nship.jpg5o\\t   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)\\n\\t\\t\\t Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or\\n\\t\\t\\t indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:\\n\\t\\t\\t the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !\\n\\nIn this case JPEG can make a file that\\'s a factor of four or five smaller\\nthan a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the\\nGIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical\\nratio for real-world scenes.\\n\\n\\n[5]  What are good \"quality\" settings for JPEG?\\n\\nMost JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by\\nselecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about\\nthe meaning of these settings.  \"Quality 95\" does NOT mean \"keep 95% of the\\ninformation\", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary;\\nit\\'s not a percentage of anything.\\n\\nThe name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting\\n(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from\\nthe original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one\\nobserver to another, but here are some rules of thumb.\\n\\nThe default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This\\nsetting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a\\ntypical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for\\nexperimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a\\nfile two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.\\n\\nIf the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to\\ngo down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you\\nmight need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.\\nThe second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.\\nThe default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to\\n95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).\\n\\nIf you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are\\nprepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is\\nabout right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as \"op art\".\\n\\n(Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG\\nsoftware described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other\\nJPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different\\nquality scale.  Some programs don\\'t even provide a numeric scale, just\\n\"high\"/\"medium\"/\"low\"-style choices.)\\n\\n\\n[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?\\n\\nMost of the programs described in this section are available by FTP.\\nIf you don\\'t know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article \"How to find sources\".\\n(If you don\\'t have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the\\nsame article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can\\nget it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with\\n\"send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources\" in the body.  The \"Anonymous FTP\\nList FAQ\" may also be helpful --- it\\'s usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in\\nthe news.answers archive.\\n\\nNOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple\\nmonths old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.\\n\\n\\n[6A]  If you are looking for \"canned\" software, viewers, etc:\\n\\nThe first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one\\nkind of system.  If you don\\'t see what you want for your machine, check out\\nthe portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this\\nlist concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over\\nInternet; but some commercial programs are listed too.\\n\\nX Windows:\\n\\nXV (shareware, $25) is an excellent viewer for JPEG, GIF, and many other\\nimage formats.  It can also do format conversion and some simple image\\nmanipulations.  It\\'s available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12),\\nfile contrib/xv-3.00.tar.Z.  Version 3.00 is a major upgrade with support\\nfor 24-bit displays and many other improvements; however, it is brand new\\nand still has some bugs lurking.  If you prefer not to be on the bleeding\\nedge, stick with version 2.21, also available from export.  Note that\\nversion 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you\\'ll get\\nonly 8-bit color), nor for converting 24-bit images to JPEG.  But 2.21 works\\nfine for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.  CAUTION: there is a\\nglitch in version 2.21: be sure to check the \"save at normal size\" checkbox\\nwhen saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry.\\n\\nAnother good choice for X Windows is John Cristy\\'s free ImageMagick package,\\nalso available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z.\\nThis package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The\\nImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped\\ndisplays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the\\nbasic free JPEG software.\\n\\nBoth of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple\\nimage viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest\\nrelease, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,\\nfile contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,\\nsaid by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.\\n(The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current\\nxloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4\\ndecoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next\\nxloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from\\nexport.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said\\nto do the right thing with 24-bit displays.\\n\\n\\nMS-DOS:\\n\\nThis covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.\\n\\nOne good choice is Eric Praetzel\\'s free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files.\\nThe current version, 2.5, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca\\n(129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip.  This is a good basic\\nviewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is\\nnot flashy, but it\\'s functional.\\n\\nAnother freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei\\'s Hiview.  The\\ncurrent version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\\nbelow), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU\\nand a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and\\nOS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no\\nbigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit\\non the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do).\\nYou may or may not prefer this approach, but there\\'s no denying that it\\nslows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a\\nbit tricky; read the directions carefully!\\n\\nA shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to\\ninstall than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is\\nalso much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use ---\\nmore keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a\\nlittle slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than\\nscreen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both\\nare faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from\\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip.\\nRequires a VESA graphics driver; if you don\\'t have one, look in vesadrv2.zip\\nor vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in\\nVESA driver, so don\\'t try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains\\nthat the driver is missing.)\\n\\nA second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around\\nthe net for a while, but I don\\'t know any stable archive location for it.\\nThe current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.\\nThe author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly\\nand it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.\\n\\nThe well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest\\nrevision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW\\'s JPEG implementation isn\\'t very good:\\nit\\'s slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is\\npoor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it\\'d have been nice to see a\\ngood JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and\\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.\\n\\nDue to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these\\nviewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can\\'t get *any*\\nof them to work, you\\'ll need to use one of the following conversion programs\\nto convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you\\nhave hi-color hardware, don\\'t use GIF as the intermediate format; try to\\nfind a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right\\nthing with hi-color displays.)\\n\\nThe Independent JPEG Group\\'s free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20\\nand mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or\\njpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS\\ncompilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will\\nconvert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.\\n\\nHandmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF.\\nThese are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in\\nparticular, you can\\'t get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major\\nadvantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI\\'s proprietary\\nJPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format\\nfiles are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version\\n2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from\\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip.\\nNOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is\\nnot readable on non-PC platforms.\\n\\nHandmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation\\npackage, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI\\nformats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images.\\nA demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from Simtel20 and\\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip.\\n\\nNOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet\\'s key archive site for PC-related programs\\nis Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20\\nruns a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document\\nrefers to directory (eg) \"msdos/graphics\" at Simtel20, that really means\\n\"pd1:<msdos.graphics>\".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should\\nexpect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several\\nInternet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives;\\nmost FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA\\nmirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files\\nin (eg) \"/pub/msdos/graphics\".  If you have no FTP capability, you can\\nretrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in\\ncomp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA,\\nconsult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.\\n\\nMicrosoft Windows:\\n\\nThere are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images.\\n(Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware,\\ndue to Windows\\' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion\\nprograms described above inside a Windows DOS window.)\\n\\nThe newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0\\nis available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip.\\nRequires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills\\nviewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it\\ndecodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.\\nBut it\\'s so fast you\\'ll use it anyway, at least for previewing...\\n\\nJView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the\\ndecompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can\\'t create new JPEG\\nfiles, and it doesn\\'t view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful\\nfeatures of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it\\'s\\nan excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from\\nftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip.\\n(Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites,\\nincluding wuarchive.wustl.edu.)\\n\\nWinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files;\\nit can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.\\nIt has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and\\nslideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror\\nsites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow\\n286-compatible version; if you register, you\\'ll get the 386-only version,\\nwhich is roughly 25% faster.)\\n\\nColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising\\ncontender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it\\nhas no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the\\ncurrent version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file\\npub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will\\nbe appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)\\n\\nDVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen\\nmode, not in a window.\\n\\nOS/2:\\n\\nThe following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151).\\nNote: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator\\nis not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip\\n    32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4.\\n/pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip\\n    16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc12.zip\\n    Image Archiver 1.02: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.\\n    Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip\\n    PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows\\n    (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview85.zip\\n    PMView 0.85: JPEG/GIF/BMP/Targa/PCX viewer.  GIF viewing very fast,\\n    JPEG viewing roughly the same speed as the above two programs.  Has\\n    image manipulation & slideshow functions.  Shareware, $20.\\n\\nMacintosh:\\n\\nMost Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple\\'s JPEG implementation, which is part of\\nthe QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed.\\nTo use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running\\nSystem 6.0.7 or later.  (If you\\'re running System 6, you must also install\\nthe 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get\\nQuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx.\\n(As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0\\nin several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and\\nconsiderably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However,\\nsome applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)\\n\\nMac users should keep in mind that QuickTime\\'s JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is\\nnot the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for\\ndetails.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format.\\nMost of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.\\n\\nThe first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images\\nthat are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can\\nconvert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big\\nimprovement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\\n(36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and\\nQuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color\\nimage quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can\\nview large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it\\'s\\nthe only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a\\ntypical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down\\nto fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other\\nviewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people\\nlike this behavior, some don\\'t.  Overall, JPEGView\\'s user interface is very\\nwell thought out.\\n\\nGIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and\\nPICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest\\nversion is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\\n/info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later.\\nGIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but\\nit has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion\\ncapabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of\\nplaying around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can\\nload and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if\\nyour machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it\\'s faster with QuickTime.)\\nNote: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try\\nconverting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.\\n\\nJPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is\\navailable from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.\\nThis will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.\\nYou can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.\\n\\nPrevious versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF\\nconverter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this\\nprogram, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.\\n\\nApple\\'s free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and\\nGIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie\\nfrom ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx.\\nRequires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer\\'s tool, and it\\'s\\nreally not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime.\\nSome of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces\\nrelatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,\\nand it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an\\nunsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not\\nintend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called\\nPICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash\\nit, as it\\'s even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much\\ncleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that\\nPicture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)\\n\\nStorm Technology\\'s Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter.\\nThis rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but\\nit will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on\\nolder systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can\\'t\\nuse it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\\n/info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a\\ndownloaded image file to \\'JPEG\\' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.\\n\\nIf your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance),\\nGIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you\\ndon\\'t want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.\\n\\nMore and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not\\nall can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version\\n2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG\\nplug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded\\nJPEG file to \\'JPEG\\' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.\\n\\nAmiga:\\n\\n(Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at\\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this\\narchive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good\\nchoice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)\\n\\nHamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a\\ngeneral image manipulation tool.  It\\'s cheap (shareware, $20) and can read\\nseveral formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version\\nis available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\\namiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger\\nthan 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.\\n\\nRend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM,\\nand GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even\\ncapturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The\\ncurrent version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror\\nsites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is\\nsupposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under\\nAmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)\\n\\nViewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04,\\navailable from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\\namiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.\\n\\nIf you\\'re willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages\\nthat support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24\\nand Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and\\nImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting,\\neffects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are\\ndistributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro),\\nfrom ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation\\nsoftware for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another\\nwell-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.\\n\\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from\\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file\\nAmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.\\n\\nThe Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many\\nbased on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks\\nto a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without\\nso much as notifying the authors).  Among these are \"AugJPEG\", \"NewAmyJPEG\",\\n\"VJPEG\", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion,\\nanything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space\\nit\\'s stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.\\n\\nAtari ST:\\n\\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc,\\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo.\\nThese programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.\\n\\nFor monochrome ST monitors, try MGIF, which manages to achieve four-level\\ngrayscale effect by flickering.  Version 4.1 reads JPEG files.

I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find\\nthe available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case,\\npurchase a hardware-assisted product.

To display a full-color image, the\\ncomputer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative\\ncolors.  This process is called \"color quantization\".  (This is something\\nof a misnomer, \"color selection\" would be a better term.  We\\'re stuck with\\nthe standard usage though.)\\n\\nClearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most\\nimages, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact\\non the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at\\nthe very lowest JPEG quality settings).\\n\\nSince JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display\\non 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for\\n*all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what\\ncomes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.\\nThis happens because JPEG\\'s lossiness affects each pixel a little\\ndifferently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably\\ncome out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets \"smeared\"\\ninto a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to\\ndisplay a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image\\nsource.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.\\n\\n(Incidentally, because of this effect it\\'s nearly meaningless to talk about\\nthe number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count\\nthe number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you\\ndifferent results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see\\nposted images described as \"256-color JPEG\".  This tells me that the poster\\n(a) hasn\\'t read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF.\\nJPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but\\nnumber of colors just isn\\'t a useful concept for JPEG.)\\n\\nOn the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to\\n256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its\\npalette, and the format doesn\\'t allow more than 256 palette entries.)\\nFor purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the\\nsender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don\\'t have to.\\nThis is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you\\'re stuck with the sender\\'s\\nquantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than\\nwhat you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer\\nimage quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.\\nFurthermore, if the sender didn\\'t use a high-quality color quantization\\nalgorithm, you\\'re out of luck.\\n\\nFor this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality\\nfor all users whose machines don\\'t match the sender\\'s display hardware.\\nJPEG\\'s full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user\\'s display\\nhardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future\\nimprovements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in\\nthis area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG\\nimages you already have.  With a GIF, you\\'re stuck forevermore with what was\\nsent.\\n\\nIt\\'s also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather\\nshoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA\\ndisplay, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you\\nneed to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color\\nquantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it\\'s\\nalso due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use\\nhigh quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in\\nnormal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be\\ndisplayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average\\nGIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!\\n\\nFinally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display\\nhardware already: 15-bit \"hi-color\" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on\\nworkstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already\\nobsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their\\ndisplay.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively.\\nThus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images\\nin a machine-independent fashion.\\n\\n\\n[8]  How does JPEG work?\\n\\nThe buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine\\ntransforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy\\ncoding.  This article\\'s long enough already, so I\\'m not going to say more\\nthan that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.\\nThis is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files\\n/pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in\\nusing the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.\\n\\n\\n[9]  What about lossless JPEG?\\n\\nThere\\'s a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did\\ndefine a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the\\nfinal output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this\\nlossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG\\nalgorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few\\nimplementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.\\n\\nSaying \"-Q 100\" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image.\\nWhat it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient\\nquantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the\\ncolor subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say\\n\"-sample 1x1\" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial\\nJPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)\\n\\nEven with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG\\nalgorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in\\nvarious calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel\\nvalue; it\\'s highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,\\nbut it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.\\n\\nAt this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps\\nhalf the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG\\nprovides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees\\nbit-for-bit accuracy.\\n\\nIf you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less\\nthan 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the\\nJBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG\\nlossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with\\n6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a\\nHuffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.\\n\\n\\n[10]  Why all the argument about file formats?\\n\\nStrictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms;\\nit does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was\\nprevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international\\nstandards organizations.\\n\\nSince we can\\'t actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on\\na common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of\\nofficial standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to\\n\"do their own thing\", and as a result their programs aren\\'t compatible with\\nanybody else\\'s.\\n\\nThe closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work\\nthat\\'s been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined\\ntwo JPEG-based file formats:\\n  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a \"low-end\" format that transports\\n    pixels and not much else.\\n  * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is\\n    a \"high-end\" format that will let you record just about everything you\\n    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is\\n    a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,\\n    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different\\n    and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It\\'s not likely that adding JPEG to the\\n    mix will do anything to improve this situation.\\nBoth of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors\\nof JPEG-related products; it\\'s reasonably likely that future commercial\\nproducts will adhere to one or both standards.\\n\\nI believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in\\npicture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the\\nTIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still\\nunusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well\\ndefined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported \"lowest common\\ndenominator\"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.\\n\\nA particular case that people may be interested in is Apple\\'s QuickTime\\nsoftware for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped\\ninside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and\\nQuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are\\navailable to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor\\nthat handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF\\nby hand; see section 11 for details.\\n\\nAnother particular case is Handmade Software\\'s programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and\\nImage Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF\\nformat.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by\\nHSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be\\nused for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This\\napplies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF\\nformat by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format\\nfiles, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)\\n\\n\\n[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?\\n\\nIf you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won\\'t read, it\\'s likely\\nto be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell\\nwhat you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:\\n\\n1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,\\n    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by \\'JFIF\\'.\\n\\n2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a\\n    \"raw JPEG\" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---\\n    it\\'s worth a try, anyway.\\n\\n3.  HSI files start with \\'hsi1\\'.  You\\'re out of luck unless you have HSI\\n    software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they\\n    won\\'t decompress properly with non-HSI programs.\\n\\n4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred\\n    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for \\'JFIF\\').  Strip off\\n    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.\\n\\n5.  Anything else: it\\'s a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are\\n    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.\\n    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),\\n    try stripping off everything before that.\\n\\nIn uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is\\n\\n\\t\"begin\" line\\n\\tM_]C_X ...\\n\\nwhereas uuencoded HSI files will start with\\n\\n\\t\"begin\" line\\n\\tM:\\'-I ...\\n\\nIf you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of\\ndownloading non-JFIF files.\\n\\n\\n[12]  What about arithmetic coding?\\n\\nThe JPEG spec defines two different \"back end\" modules for the final output\\nof compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.\\nThe choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually\\nproduces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding\\nproduces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the\\nfile-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)\\n\\nUnfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the\\nJPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.\\nThus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses\\nfrom these companies.  (The \"fair use\" doctrine allows people to implement\\nand test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious\\nat best.)\\n\\nAt least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about\\narithmetic coding; the space savings isn\\'t great enough to justify the\\npotential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not*\\nbe used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.\\n\\nThere is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the\\nfuture.  Stay tuned for further details.\\n\\n\\n[13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?\\n\\nIt would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could\\ndecompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it\\nwithout any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.\\nUnfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered\\nimage loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the\\nfirst time around.\\n\\nThe next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress\\nit *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an\\nidentical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current\\nfree JPEG software.  It\\'s essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff\\nerror.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually\\ndegrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation\\noutput.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)\\nOne of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can\\nbe avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.\\n\\nIn any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that\\ncompressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original\\nquality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes\\nas cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.\\n(If you\\'re wondering why, it\\'s because the pixel-block boundaries move.\\nIf you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but\\nthat\\'s a mighty limited capability!)\\n\\nThe bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and\\ntransmission of images, but you don\\'t want to use it as an intermediate\\nformat for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format\\n(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are\\nready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot\\nof compression/decompression time this way :-).\\n\\n\\n[14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?\\n\\nAs stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you\\nconvert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original\\nfull-color data the GIF was made from, it\\'s far better to make a JPEG from\\nthat.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,\\nhere are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum\\nloss of quality.\\n\\nThe first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to\\nmake sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;\\nthat will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality\\nsetting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in\\nsection 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors\\ndon\\'t convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality\\nwill be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)\\n\\nExperience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best\\ncandidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer\\nthe most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.\\nDon\\'t waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don\\'t\\nexpect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created\\ndirectly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have\\nto let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through\\nJPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file,\\nnot 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).\\n\\nMany people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color\\nborder around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of\\nstorage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp\\nborder boundary can create visible artifacts (\"ghost\" edges).  Do yourself\\na favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows\\nsystem, XV\\'s manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless\\nway to do this.)\\n\\ncjpeg\\'s default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but\\nfor GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid\\nimage degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher\\nQ setting may not be necessary.)\\n\\nColor GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually \"dithered\" to fool\\nyour eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.\\nIf you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of\\nsignificantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels\\ntogether to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The\\ntrouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency\\ncolor noise; and JPEG can\\'t compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG\\nfile is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have\\ngotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).\\nTo get around this, you want to \"smooth\" the GIF image before compression.\\nSmoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that\\nyou thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid\\ncolor changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will\\noften let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of\\nthe compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image\\nthan you\\'d get without smoothing.\\n\\nWith the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing\\ncapability is built in.  Try \"-smooth 10\" or so when converting GIFs.\\nValues of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed\\ndithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular\\nfine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong\\nsmoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur\\nthe output image, which you don\\'t want.  If you are an image processing\\nwizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as\\npnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg\\'s built-in smoother is\\na LOT faster than pnmconvol...\\n\\nThe upshot of all this is that \"cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10\" is probably a\\ngood starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the\\nimage, you\\'ll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.\\n\\n\\n---------------------\\n\\nFor more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in\\nparticular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.\\n\\n-- \\n\\t\\t\\ttom lane\\n\\t\\t\\torganizer, Independent JPEG Group\\nInternet: tgl@cs.cmu.edu\\tBITNET: tgl%cs.cmu.edu@carnegie\\n'),\n",

Specifically, a comparison between the\\nCanon BJ200 (BubbleJet) and the Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 500.  Many people\\nasked me to post the summary/account of all the postings and e-mail I\\nreceived.  Below is my original query and the responses I received.  I have\\nnot deleted any part of the responses, only the headers and signatures, so\\nyou can extract what you find necessary.  Some people asked me for an\\nunbiased account; however, the very nature of the question suggests\\nfavoritism and biased comments, you must extract the information you\\nbelieve unbiased and a fair representation of each printer.  There are a\\nwide range of comments, each has its own value.  \\n\\nThere was no clear winner, some like the BJ200 (especially its\\nprice/performance ratio), others preferred the durability and reliability\\nof the DeskJet (the original inkjet with proven drivers and a solid\\nbackground).  Two new inkjet printers have drawn some attention, a new\\nprinter to be introduced by Hewlett-Packard later this year (around\\nsummertime), and an addition to the Epson product line (their first\\ninkjet).  You will find that after the initial purchase, the costs of\\nre-filling or replacing the ink cartridges are about the same (this largely\\ndepends on where you purchase the re-fills or replacements -- so shop\\naround first since this aspect will most likely dominate the cost of your\\nprinter).  No one mentioned approx. how many sheets each ink cartridge will\\nprint, but I suspect they are roughly equal at about 1000 - 1500 sheets\\n(laser printers will do 4000-5000 sheets per toner cartridge).  Well,\\nthat\\'s a brief research summary of my personal research.  ENJOY!\\n\\n===========================================================================\\n\\n>Hello fellow \\'netters.\\n>\\n>I am asking for your collected wisdom to help me decide which printer I\\n>should purchase, the Canon BJ200 (BubbleJet) vs. the HP DeskJet 500.

Just using regular copier paper\\nproduced fantastic results just in high quality mode.  I compared the\\noutput of a Micrografx Designer legal size drawing with 4pt type done on my\\nBJ 200 with the same drawing printed on an HP Laserjet IID and I was amazed\\nhow well I could read the small print on the BJ 200.

I measured the time from when the printer first\\nindicated it was receiving data (as I used print manager in Windows).\\n\\nI showed the output to several people at work and one manager bought one\\nimmediately for his office, and two other engineers placed their orders\\ntoo.  If you need CDW\\'s phone number, it\\'s 800-598-4239.  Delivery to NY\\nwas two days.\\n\\nGood luck!\\n\\n\\nCraig Witkowski, CENG51@maccvm.corp.mot.com\\nMotorola Communications & Electronics Inc.\\nGlen Rock,  NJ\\n\\n===========================================================================\\n\\nI own a Deskjet 500. Performance isn\\'t spectacular under Windows using\\nTrueType fonts but neither is the Canon from what I have seen. Quality for\\nthe HP is very much dependent on paper quality - on \\'standard\\' photo-copy\\npaper the characters have slightly \\'frayed\\' edges but on better quality\\n\\'distinction\\' type paper things look better. For most applications I find\\ncopy paper fine - still better than dot-matrix.  Comes with a Windows\\ndriver, which seems to by-pass print manager, has a few\\n\\'intelli-fonts\\'which are HP scaleable fonts - probably faster than TrueType\\nbut haven\\'t really tried them out. Can get RAM & FONT cartridges but unless\\nthe speed of TrueType is a problem I wouldn\\'t bother. The RAM cartridges\\ncan\\'t be used as buffer - soft fonts only.\\n\\nFor graphics, i.e. BMP images etc the HP can be put into a dither mode via\\nthe HP supplied Win driver. There a number of dither options such as\\n\\'scatter\\', \\'pattern\\' etc.  The manual gives recommendations depending on\\nthe type of image being printed.  Text is not so good in this mode. Problem\\narises when you have a document which contains both graphic and text.  The\\nrange of tones for graphic images isn\\'t brilliant but I think that is more\\nof a limitation with inkjet printers in general.\\n\\n>From what I have seen the Canon is similar in most respects.\\n\\nHowever, a printer definitely worth looking at is the new inkjet from\\nEpson.  This printer is faster, cheaper, and capable of producing\\nlaser-like quality on normal copier paper.  Can\\'t remember the model #, LX\\n- something I think?\\n\\nI purchased my HP days before the Epson was released here :-{.  The\\nintroductory price on the Epson was the same as the HP here in New Zealand.\\n \\n===========================================================================\\n\\nAbout a month ago, I got a Canon BJ200.  I absolutely LOVE it.  It is\\nincredibly fast, except for printing from PSPICE (I don\\'t know if you ever\\ndo stuff with that or not.)  Most of the stuff I print is either from\\nMicrosoft Word for Windows or just plain text.  The only problems I\\'ve had\\nare printing headers/footers (the printer freaked out), and printing on\\ncheap paper (lots of streaks).  Normal copy paper works great with it, you\\ncan only tell it\\'s not laser-printed by holding it, oh, less than twelve\\ninches from your face.  (That is, if you\\'re nearsighted, like me! :) ) The\\nprinter comes with its own driver for Windows 3.1!!  I have no other\\ncomplaints.  The printer also can act just like some EPSON or another for\\nthose archaic software packages that haven\\'t written a driver for it yet.\\nThe teeny-weeny footprint is a real plus, too--AND, if you purchase it\\nbetween now and May 31, you get a $50 rebate from Canon!!  I bought mine\\nfrom a store called CompUSA, and the price now is $340.  I have a friend\\nwho has the HP you are looking at.  It also prints very well, and everyone\\nhas drivers for it, BUT it is VERY slow!\\n\\nHope I helped!\\n\\n(360dpi sure looks great!)\\n\\nHeather Stehman\\n\\n===========================================================================\\n\\nIn article <1993Apr19.122649.25263@schbbs.mot.com>, CENG51@maccvm.corp.mot.com (Craig Witkowski) writes:\\n> In message <1993Apr18.041741.6051@CSD-NewsHost.Stanford.EDU>\\n> kayman@csd-d-3.Stanford.EDU (Robert Kayman) writes:\\n> Hello fellow \\'netters.\\n> \\n>>I am asking for your collected wisdom to help me decide which printer I\\n>>should purchase, the Canon BJ200 (BubbleJet) vs. the HP DeskJet 500.

I prefer the Deskjet.  The printing speed and quality\\nare similar (I tested both with text and graphics before buying the Deskjet\\nfor home).  The feature that sets the Deskjet apart is the driver support\\nin so many applications.  The BJ ends up emulating the Epson LQ or IBM\\nProprinter to get it to work with many non-windows apps and this will be\\nthe case for a long time.  The design is superior if you just want to use\\ncut paper, the Deskjet is quieter, AND the ink cartridges are quite a bit\\ncheaper due to the number of Deskjets out there in comparision to the BJs.\\n\\n  Just my $0.02 worth..\\n\\n-- \\nMike Mattix\\nAgricultural Group of Monsanto\\nP.O. Box 174\\nLuling, LA 70070\\nINTERNET Address: dmmatt@bigez.monsanto.com\\n\\n===========================================================================\\n\\n  Yes, there is the landscape mode printing problem, but it does not\\npresent a problem in Windows as the Windows printer driver handles the\\ntranslation.  I actually thought of some other points after I posted the\\nnote.  The Deskjet has an unprintable area of approximately .5inch around\\nthe paper the Bubblejet does not.  You are right about the graphics\\nresolutions, I tested the printers with the applications I had access to:\\nWordperfect, Harvard Graphics, WinGIF, Paintshop PRO, and Paintbrush and\\ncould not tell a difference.  In fact one of the HP Deskjet Windows drivers\\ngives you significant control over the contrast and density of the printer\\nhence controlling the amount of ink you put down.  The Bubblejet did not.\\nI had no imaging software to test the printers with and so had no\\ncomparision there.  Finally, I wanted sheet feeding.  In that configuration\\nthe Bubblejet cost approximately $100 more than the Deskjet.\\n\\nI went through a pretty thorough evaluation and chose the Deskjet when I\\nspent my own money.  BTW, I am replacing the BJ-300 with a Deskjet 500 at\\nwork this month anyway.\\n\\nRegards\\n\\nMike Mattix\\nAg Group of Monsanto\\nLuling, LA\\n\\n===========================================================================\\n\\nI spent some time comparing the two.  We ended up getting the Bubblejet\\nBJ-200 versus the HP.  Our reasons were:\\n\\n1) The HP seemed to have worse banding than the Canon\\n2) 360dpi versus 300 - we felt we could see the difference\\n3) Price - Canon has a $50 rebate program going on at the moment.\\n\\nThe BJ-200 was our choice over the BJ-10ex - we could have 100 pages in the\\nBJ-200 feeder.  The BJ-10ex holds only 30 pages, I think.\\n\\nAs you can see, up to 100 pages on the BJ-200.  We haven\\'t done anything\\nbig with the BJ, but its performance seems reasonable under Windows.  I\\nknow that the Microsoft BBS has a newer windows driver than comes with the\\nprinter, but I don\\'t know how it compares (also the driver included with\\nthe printer is Canon\\'s whereas I don\\'t know where the Microsoft BBS one\\ncomes from - Microsoft?)\\n\\nHope this helps.\\n-- \\nThomas V.

The printing quality is a bit better,\\nbut you you\\'ve got much more possiblities. Don\\'t forget the HP engine is at\\nleast 2 years on the marked, the Canon engine (witch is also used in\\nother \"new\" bubblejet printers like e.g. the Epson ones) is quite recently\\navailable..\\n\\n> Now, I would greatly appreciate any information you could render on the 360\\n> dpi of the Canon BubbleJet vs. the Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 500 (300 dpi).\\n> Which is faster?

Which will handle large documents better (75\\n\\nI\\'ve seen during a short demonstration (from someone who tryed to sell me\\nCanon printers) 2 times the same picture, one printed with the BJ200, one\\nwith the Canon, the other with the HP, and.. there was a difference in\\nprinting- quality,.. The Canon was a bit better..\\n\\nGreetz,\\n\\nKris\\n\\n===========================================================================\\n\\nWhen we decided we needed quiet printers in our hospital we looked to\\ninkjet printers.  They have near laser quality, speed, and they are quiet.\\nWe use both HP Deskjets and the Canon BJ-200s.  I prefer the paper handling\\nqualities of the Deskjets but I feel the Canons have superior print\\nquality.  The Ideal would be a Canon with a sheet feeder, however I did end\\nup buying a deskjet for home use (got too good a deal).  Anyway, we are\\nusing Canons in high volume areas and they are holding up very well.  Out\\nof 15 Deskjets and 4 BJ-200s I have only had one problem with a deskjet and\\nthat was taken care of very quickly by HP.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t-Nate\\n\\n===========================================================================\\n\\nWhenever I buy anything I look at what the \"experts\" say, pick out the top\\nfew and then buy on whatever criteria are the most apt.  I\\'ve been\\nunusually flush lately (no begging letter please) and so I\\'ve done this a\\nfew times including - about four months ago - with inkjet printers.\\n\\nI can\\'t remember much about the process except that I read about three\\nreviews of inkjets and that the 500 was always at or near the top.  I\\nbought the 500C because of the added dimension of colour (I intend to build\\na multi- media machine at some stage and have just bought a colour scanner\\ntowards that).  Although I haven\\'s used the colour thing in earnest yet I\\ntried it out on a couple of Windows bitmaps and I was pleased with the\\nresult.\\n\\nI note that even though you can now get the 550C (the one with both colour\\nand mono with no need to change the cartridge), the 500C and 500 are still\\nreadily available (at least in the UK).  The following are my\\nviews/experience:\\n\\n\\t1.\\tI don\\'t know anything about the Canon except that I came away\\n\\t\\tfrom reviews (and replies to a posting similar to yours) with\\n\\t\\tthe idea that the HP offered the best performance/price ratio.\\n\\n\\t2.\\tI believe HP are the originals in the field - not always the\\n\\t\\tideal place to be but the market\\'s still young so one assumes\\n\\t\\tthey have the expertise.\\n\\n\\t3.\\tThe 500C is worth the extra.  Operation in mono is perfectly\\n\\t\\tacceptable and I get good crisp reproduction of fonts from\\n\\t\\tWindows.\\n\\n\\t4.\\tI used to work for Monotype when they still manufactured\\n\\t\\ttypesetters (before their AMERICAN owners closed them down!)\\n\\t\\tand I can tell you that in terms of definition 300 dpi is\\n\\t\\tpretty poor anyway so 360 dpi is just a bit less poor...\\n\\n\\t5.\\tThe HP comes with a reasonable set of drivers.\\n\\n\\t6.\\tIf you buy it invest in the additional RAM pack - it\\'s pretty\\n\\t\\tslow with it, God knows what it\\'s like without!\\n\\nI actually work in Germany and my PC is home in the UK so it\\'s not in daily\\nuse.  I would say that apart from my not reading the manual properly and\\nhaving a really dumb problem at the start it\\'s easy peasy to operate.\\n\\nHope this is of use.\\n\\nRegards\\n\\nDavid\\t\\n\\n===========================================================================\\n\\nJust bought the BJ-200.  I thought the price couldn\\'t be beat ($329, with\\n$50 rebate thru 5/31) and so far it is comparable, even superior, to the\\nDeskJet in print quality.\\n\\nSpeed:   Per page rate seems to be faster (I don\\'t have figures).\\n         I don\\'t print long docs, though.\\n\\nQuality: I think the graphics quality is excellent.  Print quality is\\n         excellent as well, unless you use small fonts and hold it up\\n         close; you can see a lot more \"jaggies\" than on a LaserJet.\\n         The 360 dpi is offset by a little less accuracy in holding the\\n         page/print head in place, I would imagine.\\n\\nLarge docs:  Not room in the standard model for a whole lotta pages ...\\n         manual says up to 100, though.  Haven\\'t tried it.\\n\\nDrivers:  No problems under Win3.1 yet.  WinWord doesn\\'t want to print\\n         the envelopes the same way the Canon does, though.\\n\\nKnow nothing of add-on costs.\\n\\n Daniel A.

I can compare\\nit with the HP LaserJet IIID PostScript and they look almost identical (\\ndepending on the kind of paper).  I don\\'t have problems with the ink not\\nbeing dry, it seems to dry VERY fast.  Probably within a second.

I\\'m a little behind in news reading\\nso I know this may be late.\\n\\n  I just purchased the Canon Bubblejet last night.  I was really worried\\nthat I wouldn\\'t like it but the print quality, and noise level is\\nfantastic!  I printed quite a few documents with lots of graphics and it\\nprinted DAMN near laser quality.  You can\\'t tell it\\'s not laser unless you\\nget 2 inches from the page.\\n\\n  no problems with drivers.  The printer came with the driver diskette\\nwhich is good because I was beginning to panic when I couldn\\'t findi it\\nunder Windows or WordPerfect.  It works well under both.  I have yet to\\ninstall Word for Windows so don\\'t know how it works with them.\\n\\n  I had a DeskJet 500 at work last year.  It was a good printer as well ut\\nI felt it was awfully slow.

In the general\\npopulation, NT\\'s comprise only about 12% of the population, but among\\nphysicians it is much much higher (I don\\'t know the exact percentage -\\nany help here a.p.p.er\\'s?)\\n\\nOne driving characteristic of an NT, especially an NTJ, is their obvious\\ncholeric behavior (driver, type A, etc.) - the extreme emotional need to\\ncontrol, to lead, and/or to be the best or the most competent.  If they are\\nalso extroverted, they are best described as \"Field Marshalls\".  This trait\\nis very valuable and essential in our society - we need people who want to\\nlead, to strive to overcome the elements, to seek and thirst for knowledge,\\nto raise the level of competency, etc.  The great successes in science and\\ntechnology are in large part due to the vision (an N trait) and scientifically-\\nminded approach (T trait) of the NT personality (of course, the other types\\nand temperaments have their own positive contributions as well).  However,\\nwhen the NT person has self-image challenges, the \"dark-side\" of this\\npersonality type usually comes out, which should be obvious to all.\\n\\nA physician who is a strong NT and who has not learned to temper their\\ntemperament will be extremely business-like (lack of empathy or feeling),\\nand is very compelled to have total control over their patient (the patient\\nmust be obedient to their diagnosis and prescription without question).

Of course, I believe that I have\\nbeen misdiagnosed on the net as suffering from \\'anal retentivitis\\', but being\\nthe phlegmatic I am, maybe I was just a little too harsh on a few people\\nmyself in past posts.  Let\\'s all try to raise the level of this discussion\\nabove the level of anal effluent.\\n\\n\\n>...Humans have all \\n>kinds of different organisms living in the GI system (mouth, stomach, small \\n>and large intestine), sinuses, vagina and on the skin.

But any of \\n>these organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up \\n>residence within the body.  A poor mucus membrane barrier can let this \\n>happen and vitamin A is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier.\\n\\nIn my well-described situation (in prior posts), I definitely was immune\\nstressed.  Blood tests showed my vitamin A levels were very low.  My sinuses\\nwere a mess - no doubt the mucosal lining and the cilia were heavily damaged.\\nI also was on antibiotics 15 times in 4 years!  In the end, even two weeks\\nof Ceftin did not work and I had confirmed diagnoses of a chronic bacterial\\ninfection of the sinuses via cat-scans, mucus color (won\\'t get into the\\ndetails), and other symptoms.  Three very traditional ENT\\'s made this\\ndiagnosis (I did not have any cultures done, however, because of the\\ndifficulty of doing this right and because my other symptoms clearly showed\\na bacterial infection).  Enough of this background (provided to help you\\nunderstand where I was when I make comments about my Sporanox anti-fungal\\ntherapy below).\\n\\n\\nThe first question I have is this.  Can fungus penetrate a little way into poor\\nmucus membrane tissue, maybe via hyphae, thus causing symptoms, without being\\nconsidered \\'systemic\\' in the classic sense?  It is sort of an inbetween\\ninfection.\\n\\n\\n>Steve got real upset with Elaine\\'s doctor because he was using anti-fungals \\n>and vitamin A for her GI problems.  If Steve really understoood what \\n>vitamin A does in the body, he would not(or at least should not) be calling \\n>Elaine\\'s doctor a quack.\\n\\nI was concerned, too, because of the toxicity of vitamin A.  My doctor, after\\nmy blood tests, put me on 75,000 IU of vitamin A for one week only, then\\ndropped it down to 25,000 IU for the next couple of weeks.  I also received\\nzinc and other supplementation, since all of these interrelate in fairly\\ncomplex ways as my doctor explained (he\\'s one of those \\'evil\\' orthomolecular\\nspecialists).  I had a blood test three weeks later and vitamin A was normal,\\nhe then stopped me on all vitamin A (except for some in a multi-vitamin)\\nsupplement), and made sure that I maintain a 50,000 IU/day of beta carotene.\\nCall me carrot face.  :^)\\n\\nHopefully, Elaine\\'s doctor will take a similar, careful approach and to\\nall supplements.  I\\'m even reevaluating some supplements I\\'m taking, for\\nexample, niacin in fairly large dosages, 1 gram/day, which Steve Dyer had\\ngood information about on sci.med.nutrition.  If niacin only has second-order\\nimprovement in symptomatic relief of my sinus allergies, then it probably is\\nnot worth taking such a large dose long-term and risking liver damage.\\n\\n\\n>survives.  If it gets access to a lot of glucose, it blooms and over rides \\n>the other organisms living with it in the sinuses, GI tract or vagina.  In \\n\\nThough I do now believe, based on my successful therapy with Sporanox, that\\nI definitely had some excessive growth of fungus (unknown species) in my\\nsinuses, I still want to ask the question:  have there been any studies that\\ndemonstrate candida \"blooms\" in the sinuses with associated sinus irritation\\n(sinusitis/rhinitis)?  (My sinus irritation reduced significantly after one\\nweek of Sporanox and no other new treatments were implemented during this\\ntime - I did not have any noticeable GI track problems before starting on\\nSporanox, but some for a few days after which then went away - considered\\nnormal).\\n\\nBTW, my doctor dug out one of his medical reference books (sorry, can\\'t\\nremember which one), and found an obscure comment dating back into the 1950\\'s\\nwhich stated that people can develop contained (non-lethal or non-serious)\\naspergillis infestations (aspergiliosis) of the sinuses leading to sinus\\ninflammation symptoms.  I\\'ll have to dig out that reference again since it\\nis relevant to this discussion.\\n\\n\\n>some people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus \\n>membrane or skin bloom site.  Whether this is an allergic like reaction to \\n>the candida or not isn\\'t certain.\\n\\nMy doctor tested me (I believe a RAST or RAST similar test) for allergic\\nresponse to specificially Candida albicans, and I showed a strong positive.\\nAnother question, would everybody show the same strong positive so this test\\nis essentially useless?  And, assuming it is true that Candida can grow\\npart-way into the mucus membrane tissue, and the concentration exceeds a \\nthreshold amount, could not a person who tests as having an allergy to\\nCandida definitely develop allergic symptoms, such as mucus membrane\\nirritation due to the body\\'s allergic response?  As I said in an earlier post,\\none does not need to be a rocket scientist, or have a M.D. degree or a \\nPh.D. in biochemistry to see the plausibility of this hypothesis.\\n\\nBTW, and I\\'ll repost this again.  Dr. Ivker, in his book, \"Sinus Survival\",\\nhas routinely given, before anything else, Nizoral (a pre-Sporanox systemic\\nanti-fungal, not as safe and not as good as Sporanox) to his new chronic\\nsinusitis patients IF they have been on antibiotics four or more times in\\nthe last two years.  He claims that out of 2000 or so patients, well over\\n90% notice some relief of sinus inflammation and other symptoms, but it\\ndoesn\\'t cure it by any means, implying the so-called yeast/fungus infection\\nis not the primary cause, but a later complication.  He\\'s also found that\\nnystatin, whether taken internally, or put into a sinus spray, does not help.\\n\\nThis implies (of course assuming that excessive yeast/fungus bloom is\\naggravating the sinus inflammation) that the yeast/fungus has grown partway\\ninto the tissue since nystatin will not kill yeast/fungus other than by\\ndirect contact - it is not absorbed into the blood stream.  Again, I admit,\\nlots of \\'ifs\\', and \\'implies\\', which doesn\\'t please the hard-core NT who\\nhas to have the double-blind study or it\\'s a non-issue, but one has to start\\nwith some plausible hypothesis/explanation, a strawman, if you will.\\n\\n\\n>If it\\'s internal, only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty \\n>nondescript.  \\n\\nThis brings up an interesting observation used by those who will deny\\nand reject any and all aspects of the \\'yeast hypothesis\\' until the\\nappropriate studies are done.  And that is if you can\\'t observe or culture\\nthe yeast \"bloom\" in the gut or sinus, then there\\'s no way to diagnose or\\neven recognize the disease.  And I know they realize that it is virtually\\nimpossible to test for candida overbloom in any part of the body that cannot\\nbe easily observed since candida is everywhere in the body.\\n\\nIt\\'s a real Catch-22.\\n\\nAnother Catch-22:  Those who totally reject the \\'yeast hypothesis\\' say that\\nno studies have been done (actually studies have been done, but if it\\'s not\\nup to a certain standard then it is, from their perspective, a non-study which\\nshould not even be considered).  I agree that the appropriate studies should\\nbe done, and that will take big $ to do it right.  However, in order to\\nconvince the funding agencies in these austere times to open their wallets,\\nyou literally have to give them evidence, and the only acceptable evidence to\\ncompete with other proposals is paradoxically to do almost the exact study\\nneeded funding.  That is, you have to do 90% of the study before you even get\\nfunding (as a scientist at a National Lab, I\\'m very aware of this for the\\nsmaller funded projects).  I\\'m afraid that even if Dr. Ivker and 100 other\\ndoctors got together, pooled their practice\\'s case histories and anecdotes\\ninto a compelling picture, and approach the funding agencies, they would get\\nnowhere, even if they were able to publish their statistical results.\\n\\nIt is obvious from the comments by some of the doctors here is that they have\\n*decided* excessive yeast colonization in the gut or sinuses leading to\\nnoticeable non-lethal symptoms does not exist, and is not even a tenable\\nhypothesis, so any amount of case histories or compiled anecdotal evidence\\nto the contrary will never change their mind, and not only that, they would\\nalso oppose the needed studies because in their minds it\\'s a done issue - \\nexcessive yeast growth leading to diffuse allergic symptoms does not, will\\nnot, and cannot exist.  Period.  Kind of tough to dialog with those who hold\\nsuch a viewpoint.  Kind of reminds me of Lister...\\n\\n\\n>Candida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in \\n>the sinuses, the GI tract(mouth, stomach and intestines) and in the \\n>vaginal tract which compete with it for food.  The human immune system \\n>ususally does not bother itself with these(nonpathogenic organisms) unless \\n>they broach the mucus membrane \"barrier\".  If they do, an inflammatory \\n>response will be set up.  Most Americans are not getting enough vitamin A \\n>from their diets.  About 30% of all American\\'s die with less Vitamin A than \\n>they were born with(U.S. autopsy studies).  While this low level of vitamin \\n>A does not cause pathology(blindness) it does impair the mucus membrane \\n>barrier system.  This would then be a predisposing factor for a strong \\n>inflammatory response after a candida bloom.  \\n\\nAren\\'t there also other nutrients necessary to the proper working of the\\nsinus mucus membranes and cilia?\\n\\n\\n>While diabetics can suffer from a candida \"bloom\" the  most common cause of \\n>this type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which \\n>knock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main \\n>competition for candida as far as food is concerned.  While drugs are \\n>available to handle candida, many patients find that their doctor will not \\n>use them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection.  The toxicity of \\n>the anti-fungal drugs does warrant some caution.  But if the GI or sinus \\n>inflammation is suspected to be candida(and recent use of a broad spectrum \\n>antibiotic is the smoking gun), then anti-fungal use should be approrpriate \\n>just as the anti-fungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring \\n>vaginal yeast infections, in spite of what Mr. Steve Dyer says.\\n\\nAgain, the evidence from mycological studies indicate that many yeast/fungus\\nspecies can grow hyphae (\"roots\") into deep tissue, similar to mold growing\\nin bread.  You can continue to kill the surface, such as nystatin does, but\\nyou can\\'t kill that which is deeper in the tissue without using a systemic\\nanti-fungal such as itraconazole (Sporanox) or some of the older ones such\\nas Nizoral which are more toxic and not as effective.  This is why, as has\\nbeen pointed out by recent studies (sent to me by a doctor I\\'ve been in\\ne-mail contact with - thanks), that nystatin is not effective in the long-\\nterm treatment of GI tract \"candidiasis\".  It\\'s like trying to weed a garden\\nby cutting off what\\'s above the ground but leaving the roots ready to come\\nout again once you walk away.\\n\\nThe $60000 question is whether a contained candida \"bloom\" can partially\\ngrow into tissue through the mucus membranes, causing some types of symptoms\\nin susceptible people (e.g., allergy), without becoming \"systemic\" in the\\nclassical sense of the word - something in between strictly an excessive\\nbloom not causing any problems and the full-blown systemic infection that\\nis potentially lethal.\\n\\n\\n>In the GI system, the ano-rectal region seems to be a particularly good \\n>reservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very \\n>favorable environment around the rectum for transfer(through moisture and \\n>humidity) of candida to the vaginal tract.  One of the most effctive ways to \\n>minimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear.  \\n\\nAlso, if one is an \\'anal retentive\\', like I\\'ve been diagnosed in a prior\\npost, that can also provide more sites for excessive candida growth.  ;^)\\n\\n\\n>If the bloom occurs in the anal area, the burning, swelling, pain and even \\n>blood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids.  If the \\n>bloom manages to move further up the GI tract, very diffuse symptomatology \\n>occurs(abdominal discomfort and blood in the stool).  This positive stool \\n>for occult blood is what sent Elaine to her family doctor in the first \\n>place.  After extensive testing, he told her that there was nothing wrong \\n>but her gut still hurt.  On to another doctor, and so on.  Richard Kaplan \\n>has told me throiugh e-mail that he considers occult blood tests in stool \\n>specimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of \\n>false positives(candida blooms guys?).  If my gut hurt me on a constant \\n>basis, I would want it fixed.  Yes it\\'s nice to know that I don\\'t have \\n>colon cancer but what then is causing my distress?  When I finally find a \\n>doctor who treats me and gets me 90% better, Steve Dyer calls him a quack.\\n\\nAs I\\'ve said in private e-mail, there are flaws in our current medical system\\nthat make it difficult or even impossible for a physician to attempt\\nalternative therapies AFTER the approved/proven/accepted therapies don\\'t work.\\nFor example, I went to three ENT\\'s, who all said that I will just have to live\\nwith my acute/chronic sinusitis after the ab\\'s failed (they did mention\\nsurgery to open up the ostia, but my ostia weren\\'t plugged and it would not\\nget to the root cause of my condition).  After three months of aggressive and\\nfairly non-standard therapy (Sporanox, body nutrient level monitoring and\\nequalization, vitamin C, lentinen, echinacea, etc.), my health has vastly\\nimproved to where I was two years ago, before my health greatly deteriorated.\\nOf course, skeptics would say that maybe if I did nothing I would have\\nimproved anyway, but that view is stretching things quite far because of the\\nexperience of the three ENT\\'s I saw who said that I\\'d just have to \"live with\\nit\".  I\\'m confident I will reach what one could call a total \"cure\".  The\\nanti-fungal program I undertook was one necessary step in that direction\\nbecause of my overuse of ab\\'s for the last four years.  (Note:  for those\\nhaving sinus problems, may I suggest the book by Dr. Ivker I mention above.\\nBe sure to get the revised edition.)\\n\\n\\n>...I have often wondered what an M.D. with chronic \\n>GI distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his \\n>patients is a non-existent syndrome.\\n\\nDr. Ivker started off having chronic and severe sinus problems, and his\\nvisits to several ENT\\'s totally floored him when they said \"you\\'ll just have\\nto live with it\".  He spent several years trying everything - standard and\\nnon-standard, until he was essentially cured of chronic sinusitis.  He now\\nshares his approach in his book and I can honestly say that I am on the road\\nto recovery following some parts of it.  His one recommendation to take a\\nsystemic anti-fungal at the beginning of treatment IF you have a history of\\nanti-biotic overuse has been proven to him time and time again in his own\\npractice.  I\\'m sure if I commented to him of the hard-core beliefs of the anti-\\n\"yeast hypothesis\" posters that he would have definite things to say, such as,\\n\"it\\'s worked wonders for me in almost two thousand cases\", to put it mildly.\\nI also would not be surprised if he would say that they are the ones violating\\ntheir moral obligations to help the patient.\\n\\nMaybe those doctors who are reading this who have a practice and are\\nconfronted by a patient having symptoms that could be due to the \"hypothetical\\nyeast overgrowth\" (e.g., they fit some of the profiles the pro-yeast people\\nhave identified), should consider anti-fungal therapy IF all other avenues\\nhave been exhausted.  Remember, theory and practice are two different things -\\nyou cannot have one without the other, they are synergistic.  If a doctor does\\nsomething non-standard yet produces noticeable symptomatic relief in over a\\nthousand of his patients, shouldn\\'t you at least sit up and take notice?\\nMaybe you ought to trust what he says and begin hypothesizing why it works\\ninstead of why it shouldn\\'t work.  I\\'m afraid a lot of doctors have become\\nso enamored with \"scientific correctness\" that they are ignoring the patients\\nthey have sworn to help.  You have to do both;  both have to be balanced, which\\nwe don\\'t see from some of the posters to this group.  There comes a point when\\nyou just have to use a little common sense, and maybe an empirical approach\\n(such as trying a good systemic anti-fungal such as Sporanox) after having\\nexhausted all the other avenues.  I was one of those who the traditional\\nmedical establishment was not able to help, so I did the natural thing:  I\\nwent to a couple of doctor\\'s who are (somewhat) outside this establishment,\\nand as a result I have found significant relief.\\n\\nWould it not be better if the traditional medical establishment can set up\\nsome kind of mechanism where any doctor, without fear of being sued or having\\nhis license pulled, can try experimental and unproven (beyond a doubt)\\ntherapies for his/her patients that finally reach the point where all the\\naccepted therapies are ineffective?  I\\'d like to hear a doctor tell me:\\n\"well, I\\'ve tried all the therapies that are approved and accepted in this\\ncountry, and since they clearly don\\'t work for you, I now have the authority\\nto use experimental, unproven techniques that seem to have helped others.  I\\ncan\\'t promise anything, and there are some risks.  You will have to sign\\nsomething saying you understand the experimental and possibly risky nature of\\nthese unproven therapies, and I\\'ll have to register your case at the State\\nBoard.\"  Anyway, if my ENT had suggested this to me, I would\\'ve jumped on this\\npronto instead of going to one of those doctors who, for either altruistic\\nreasons, or for greed, is practicing these alternative therapies with much\\nrisk to him/her (risk meaning losing their license) and possibly to the\\npatient.  Such a mechanism would keep control in the more mainstream medicine,\\nand also provide valuable data that would essentially be free.  It also would\\nbe morally and ethically better than the current system by showing the\\ncompassion of the medical community to the patient - that it\\'s doing everything\\nit can within reason to help the patient.  It is the lack of such a mechanism\\nthat is leading large numbers of people to try alternative therapies, some of\\nwhich seem to work (like my case), and others of which will never work at all\\n(true quackery).\\n\\nI better get off my soapbox before this post reaches 500K in size.\\n\\n\\n>If taken orally, it can also become a major bacteria in the gut.

Below is a very short\\ndescription of the process which we use; if you have further questions,\\nfeel free to poke me via e-mail.\\n\\n================================================================\\n*ASSUME: locally smooth distortion\\n\\n0) Compute the Delaunay Triangulation of your (x,y) points.  This\\n   defines the set of neighbors for each point.  If your data are\\n   not naturally convex, you may have very long edges on the convex hull.\\n   Consider deleting these edges.\\n\\n1) Now, there are two goals:\\n\\n    a) move the DistortedData(x,y) to the Reference(x,y)\\n    b) keep the Length(e) (as measured from the current (x,y)\\'s)\\n       as close as possible to the DigitizedLength(e) (as measured \\n       using the digitized (x,y)\\'s).\\n\\n2) For every point, compute a displacement based on a) and b).  For\\n   example:\\n\\n    a) For (x,y) points for which you know the Reference(x,y), you\\n       can move alpha0*(Reference(x,y) - Current(x,y)).   This will\\n       slowly move the DistortedReference(x,y) towards the\\n       Reference(x,y). \\n    b) For all other points, examine the current length of each edge.\\n       For each edge, compute a displacement which would make that edge\\n       the correct length (where \"correct\" is the DigitizedLength). \\n       Take the vector sum of these edge displacements, and move the\\n       point alpha1*SumOfEdgeDisplacements.  This will keep the\\n       triangulated mesh consistent with your Digitized mesh.\\n\\n3) Iterate 2) until you are happy (for example, no point moves very much).\\n\\nalpha0 and alpha1 need to be determined by experimentation.   Consider\\nhow much you believe the Reference(x,y) - i.e., do you absolutely insist\\non the final points exactly matching the References, or do you want to\\nbalance some error in matching the Reference against changes in length\\nof the edges.\\n\\nWARNING: there are a couple of geometric invariants which must be\\nobserved (essentially, you can\\'t allow the convex hull to change, and\\nyou can\\'t allow triangles to \"fold over\" neighboring triangles.  Both of\\nthese can be handled either by special case checks on the motion of\\nindividual points, or by periodically re-triangulating the points (using \\nthe current positions - but still calculating DigitizedLength from the\\noriginal positions.  When we first did this, the triangulation time was\\nprohibitive, so we only did it once.  If I were motivated to try and\\nchange code that has been working in production mode for 5 years, I\\n*might* go back and re-triangulate on every iteration.  If you have more\\ncompute power than you know what to do with, you might consider having\\nevery point interact with every other point....but first read up on\\nlinear solutions to the n-body problem.\\n\\nThere are lots of papers in the last 10 years of SIGGRAPH proceedings on\\nsprings, constraints,  and energy calculations which are relevant.

This impressive change in the province\\'s ethnic character \\n notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian \\n Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the \\n southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.\" \\n (See also Map 1.

Therefore, as far as we are concerned the _Covenant_\\nstill stands as the \"Bible\" (so to speak) of the mainstream Palestinian\\nNational movement!\\n\\n\\n>(Pro Israeli activists repeat it like parrots without checking its authenticity\\n>since it was coined by Bnai Brith)\\n\\nAs a staunch pro-Israel activist I can confidently say that Bnai Brith has NOT\\ninfluenced my opinions on the Arab-Israeli conflict.  As I mentioned above,\\njust a little research on the subject will lead anyone to reach a similar\\nconclusion on the Palestinian National movement (the PLO in most cases).  BB\\ndoes not properly speak for me nor many of the people around me who share\\nmy views.\\n\\n>\\n>What Hamas and Islamic Jihad believe in, as far as I can get from the Arab media,\\n>is an Islamic state that protects the rights of all its inhabitants under Koranic\\n>Law. This would be a reversal of the 1948 situation in which the Jews in\\n>Palestine took control of the land and its (mostly Muslim) inhabitants.\\n>\\n\\nWhat 1948 situation?  A negative situation I presume?  Is this the same\\n\"situation\" when the Jordanian occupiers of East Jerusalem would not allow the\\nJews to go worship at the HOLIEST SITE IN JUDIASM?  Was this an example of\\nQu\\'ranic law being exercised?  If not, I have another suggested reading for\\nyou... get into the \"soc.culture.arabic\" newsgroup where the posters have been\\ndebating the topic \"Jews in the Qu\\'ran\" (and may I remind you the people doing\\nthe debating appear to be devout Muslims with some knowledge of the Qu\\'ran).\\nYou will find that Jews aren\\'t really viewed positively by the Qu\\'ran (to put\\nit lightly).  So how do you think Jews (or any other non-Islamic religion) will\\nbe treated by an Islamic state governed by the words of the Qu\\'ran?  I think\\nthe 1948-1967 \"situation\" in Jerusalem will return *at best*!  What do you\\nthink?\\n\\n>However, whoever committed crimes against humanity (torture, blowing up their\\n>homes, murders,...) must be treated and tried as a war criminal. The political\\n>thought of these movements shows that a freedom of choice will be given to the\\n>Jews in living under the new law or leaving to the destintion of their choice.\\n\\nAll I have to say to that is, once again, see s.c.a - \"Jews in the Qu\\'ran\" and\\nthink again.  \"Freedom of choice\" is *definitely* not an option in Qu\\'ranic\\nlaw especially for non-Muslims and ALL women!  Remember the Gulf War?  I\\'m sure\\nyou saw the reports about how women had few rights in Saudi Arabia (an Islamic\\nstate).\\n\\n>\\n>As for the PLO, I am at a loss to explain what is going inside Arafat\\'s mind.\\n>\\n\\nProbably nothing!  Aside from how to break the news to his Palestinian brethren\\nthat the _Covenant_ is \"null and void\" without getting assassinated himself!\\n\\n>Although their political thinking seems far fetched with Israel acting as a true\\n>super-power in the region, the Islamic movements are using the same weapon the\\n>Jews used to establish their state : Religion.\\n>\\n\\nIn conclusion, Ahmed, you should go to the library and find the _Palestinian\\nNational Covenant (1964)_ and read it VERY CAREFULLY.  By the way, Redpath\\nLibrary DOES have it in stock because that is exactly where I found it when I\\nwas doing my research.

According\\n-> > to the Federalist Paper\\'s, a well regulated militia has a well defined \\n-> > structure and follows nationally uniform regulations.\\n-> \\n-> Perhaps you should actually READ the Federalist Papers!!\\n\\nPerhaps you should, reread Federal 29 which deals exclusively with the\\n\"well regulated malitia.\"  Here is what is says about its character:\\n\\n\\t To oblige the great body of the yeomanry, and of the other classes\\n\\t of the citizens, to be under arms for the purpose of going through\\n\\t military exercises and evolutions, as often as might be necessary to\\n\\t acquire the degree of perfection which would entitle them to the\\n\\t character of a well-regulated militia, \\n\\nIt also talks about the \"well regulated militia\" having a nationally\\nuniform in structure and disipline.  \\n\\nI will note you did quote the end of this particular paragraph which states:\\n\\n    \\tLittle more can reasonably be aimed at, with\\n\\trespect to the people at large, than to have them properly armed\\n\\tand equipped; and in order to see that this be not neglected, it\\n\\twill be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of\\n\\ta year.\\n\\nBut, do you knew how much organization is required to training a large\\ngroup of poeple twice a year.  Just to try to get the same people\\nevery year, provide a basic training to new people so they can\\nbe integrated into the force, and find a suitable location, it \\nrequires a continually standing committee of organizers.  \\n\\nSince a well regulate militia is nationally uniform in structure and\\ndisipline, and meet once or twice a year to train, how can you claim\\na \"well regulated militia\" is not well organized.  But I will concide \\na \"well organized militia\" is not necessarily a \"well regulated militia.\" \\n\\nSeveral people have stated that the \"well organized militia\" is\\nwhat is defined under 10 USC 311, which states\\n\\n\\tThe militia of the United States consists of all able-bodied \\n\\tmales at least 17 years of age and, except as provided in \\n\\tsection 313 of title 32, under 45 years of age who are, \\n\\tor who have made a declaration of intention to become, \\n\\tcitizens of the United States and of female citizents of \\n\\tthe United States who are commissioned officers of the \\n\\tNational Guard.\\n\\nThis deos define the militia, but were is the adjective \"well regulated.\"\\n10 USC 311 does not define a \"well regualed militia\" in any way, shape, \\nor form.  It only defines who can become part of a well regulated militia\\nThe Federalist Papers CLEARLY define the \"well regualed militia\" as a\\nproper SUBSET of the militia.  In the same paragraph quoted above, it\\ntalk above \"disciplining all the militia of the United States\" so they\\nfit the \"character of a well-regulated militia.\"  This is what the\\nparagraph states about the associated costs:\\n\\n\\tIt would form an annual deduction from the productive labor \\n\\tof the country, to an amount which, calculating upon the \\n\\tpresent numbers of the people, would not fall far short \\n\\tof the whole expense of the civil  establishments of all \\n\\tthe States. To attempt a thing which would abridge the \\n\\tmass of labor and industry to so considerable an extent,\\n\\twould be unwise: and the experiment, if made, could not \\n\\tsucceed, because it would not long be endured.\\n\\n\\nAnother quote provide by Charles Scripter is:\\nJames Madison, Federalist Paper 41 (regarding the \"General Welfare\" clause): \\n\\t\"Nothing is more natural nor common than first\\n\\tto use a general phrase, and then to explain and qualify it by a\\n\\trecital of particulars.\"\\n\\nSo the phrase \"the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall \\nnot be infringed\" must either qualify or explain the phrase \"a well \\nregulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state.\"  \\nThe definition of \"explain\" as stated in \"The American Hertitage\\nDictionary of the Enlish Language\" The New College Edition, 1982 is:\\n\\t1) To make plain or comprehensible; remove obscruity from;\\n\\t   elucidate: \"It was the economists who undertook to explain \\n\\t   this puzzle\"\\n\\t2) To define; explicate; expound: He explained his plan.\\n\\t3) To offer reasons for or a cause of; an answer for\\' justify:\\n\\t   explain an error\\nThe second phrase clearly does not \"explain\" the first, therefore\\nthe second phrase must \"qualify\" the first.  The definition given\\nfor \"qualify\" is:\\n\\t1) To describe by enumerating the characteristics or qualities\\n\\t   of; characterize.\\n\\t2) To make competent or suitable for office, position, or \\n\\t   task.\\n\\t3) To give legal power to; make legally capable.\\n\\t4) To modify, limit, or restrict, as giving exceptions.\\n\\t5) To make less harsh or severe; moderate\\n\\t6) Grammar: To modify the meaning of (a word or phrase)\\nSince \"the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be\\ninfringed\" does not describe, modify or make less harsh anything and\\nit has nothing to do with grammar or some sort of position or task.\\nBy process of elimination it must fall into definition #3.  And since\\n#3 deals with legal power, the same thing the Constitution does, it\\nmust be the correct definition in this case.  Therefore, \"the right \\nof the people to keep and bear Arms\" gives legal power to the \"well \\nregualated militia\" and this legal power \"shall not be infringed\".  \\n\\nI thank you very much Mr Scripter, you have provided me with more \\nevidence that the Second Amendment only concerns itseft with the \\npeople\\'s right to form well regulate militia, and says very little \\nabout the right of an untrained person to \"keep and bear\" a .50 caliber\\nmachine gun.  And since I, totally untrained in the use of any firearm\\n(something I personly have meant to correct by going to a NRA gun\\nsafety course and joining a gun club), cannot legally buy such a machine\\ngun, I conclude the courts and democraticly elected congress agree with\\nme.\\n\\n-> So now we know which category Mr. Rutledge is in; He means to destroy\\n-> our Liberties and Rights.\\n\\nI mean \"to destory our Liberties and Rights.\"  Is that why a participate\\nin the discussion of exactly what \"our Libertues and Rights\" are?

Others steered clear of such puzzle books because \\nthey were masters of incomparably more difficult branches of modern \\nmathematics and didn\\'t mind saying for all the world to hear that they didn\\'t \\nknow how to solve mere arithmetic problems. Professional mathematicians were \\nno exception. Here\\'s what the Russian mathematician Alexander Khinchin, a \\nspecialist in statistics, wrote about arithmetic: \"I willingly confess that \\nany time a fifth-grader asked me to help solve an arithmetic problem, it was\\na hard work for me, and sometimes I failed completely. Of course, like most of \\nmy friends, I could easily solve the problem by the natural algebraic route\\n--constructing equations or sets of equations. But we were supposed to avoid \\nusing algebraic analysis at all costs! . . . By the way, it\\'s a fact that is \\nwell known and oft repeated that, as a rule, neither high school graduates, \\nnor students at teaching colleges, nor teachers beginning their careers\\n(nor, I must add, scientific researchers) can solve arithmetic problems. It \\nseems the only people in the world who are able to solve them are fifth-grade \\nteachers.\"\\n\\nNow, I\\'m not insisting that a book of arithmetic problems be included in the \\nbookbag of anyone flying into space. But a sense of justice induces me to \\nrecommend one particular problem book, one that will satisfy the most \\nfastidious taste and supply food for thought sufficient not only for a \\nrelatively short flight to the Moon but for a extended space voyage--say, to\\nVenus and back.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tOne for the \"road\"\\n\\n\\tThey both took out the books they brought for the road. Kingsley \\n\\tglanced at the Royal Astronomer\\'s book and saw a bright cover with \\n\\ta group of cutthroats shooting at each other with revolvers. \"God \\n\\tknows what this kind of stuff leads to,\" thought Kingsley.\\n\\n\\tThe Royal Astronomer looked at Kingsley\\'s book and saw the History \\n\\tof Herodotus. \"Good Lord, next he\\'ll be reading Thucydides,\" thought \\n\\tthe Royal Astronomer.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t--Fred Hoyle, The Black Cloud\\n\\nThe book I\\'m talking about isn\\'t very big, but its 24 problems constitute 24 \\nelegant miniatures from seventh-century Armenia. Naive and wise at the same\\ntime, rich in striking detail and the bright coloration of the period, these \\nproblems are reminiscent of the reliefs on the famous monument of Armenian \\narchitecture, the church on the island of Akhtamar in Lake Van (in what is \\nnow Turkey_. They are as inseparable from the image of Armenia as the elegant \\nletters of the Armenian alphabet, invented by Mesrop Mashtots, or the songs of \\nKomitas, or the paintings of Saryan.\\n\\nAn edition of these incredibly beautiful problems has long been a \\nbibliographic rarity. It was published under the title Problems and Solutions\\nof Vardapet [1] Anania of Shirak, Armenian Mathematician of the Seventh \\nCentury (translated and published by I. A. Orbeli, Petrograd, 1918).\\n\\nThe abundance of close observations and wide-ranging information about the way \\nof life and customs of that remote epoch when Anania of Shirak lived and \\nworked have actually rendered a disservice to his problem book. For many years \\nthe book was known only to researchers in the humanities--specialists in \\nArmenian history who jealously guarded their treasure and wouldn\\'t let just\\nanyone see it. Even now, after research by K. P. Patkanov, the learned monk \\nFather Kaloust, J.I. Orbeli, A. Abramyan, V. K. Chaloyan, and others has \\nbrought the works of Anania of Shirak to light in scholarly circles, the \\ngeneral reader remains ignorant of the very existence of this remarkable \\nproblem book.\\n\\n\\t\\tVardapet Anania of Shirak\\n\\n\\tOnce fell in love with the art of calculation, I thought that no \\n\\tphilosophical notion can be constructed without number, considering \\n\\tit the mother of all wisdom.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t--Anania of Shirak\\n\\nAmong ancient Armenian thinkers, Vardapet Anania of Shirak stands out because \\nof the breadth of his interests and the unique mathematical orientation of his \\nwork. Some of his works have been preserved. In addition to the Problems and\\nSolutions, the following tracts have found a special place in the estimation\\nof scholars: On Weights and Measures, Cosmography and Calendrical Theory, and\\nArmenian Geography of the Seventh Century A.D. (the authorship of the last\\nwork was long attributed to another outstanding thinker of ancient Armenia, \\nMovses of Khoren).\\n\\nIn his autobiography, Anania of Shirak has this to say about himself:\\n\\n\\tI, Anania of Shirak, having studied all the science of our\\n\\tArmenian land and having learned the Holy Scripture intimately, \\n\\tin the expression of the psalmist, \"every day I illuminated the \\n\\teyes of my mind.\" Feeling myself lacking in the art of calculation,\\n\\tI came to the conclusion that it is fruitless to study philosophy, \\n\\tthe mother of all sciences, without number. I could find in Armenia \\n\\tneither a man versed in philosophy nor books that explained the \\n\\tsciences. I therefore went to Greece and met in Theodosiople a man \\n\\tnamed Iliazar who was well versed in ecclesiastical works. He told me\\n\\tthat in Forth Armenia [2] there lived a famous mathematician,\\n\\tChristosatur. I went this person and spent six months with him. But \\n        soon I noticed that Christosatur was a master not of all science but \\n        only of certain fragmentary facts.\\n\\n\\tI then went to Constantinople, where I met acquaintances who told me: \\n\\t\"Why did you go so far, when much closer to us, in Trebizon, on the \\n\\tcoast of Pontus [3] lives the Byzantine vardapet Tyukhik. He is full \\n\\tof wisdom, is known to kings, and knows Armenian literature.\" I asked \\n\\tthem how they knew this. They answered: \"We saw ourselves that many \\n\\tpeople traveled long distances to become pupils of so learned a man. \\n\\tIndeed the archdeacon of the patriarchate of Constantinople,\\n\\tPhilagrus, traveled with us, bringing many young persons to become \\n\\tpupils of Tyukhik.\" When I heard this, I expressed my gratitude to \\n\\tGod, who had quenched the thirst of His slave.\\n\\n\\tI went to Tyukhik at the monastery of St. Eugene and explained why I \\n\\thad come. He received me graciously and said: \"I praise Our Lord that \\n\\tHe sent you to learn and to transplant science in the domain of St. \\n\\tGregory; I am glad that all your country will learn from me. I myself \\n\\tlived in Armenia for many years as a youth. Ignorance reigned there.\" \\n\\tVardapet Tyukhik loved me as a son and shared all his thoughts with \\n\\tme. The Lord bestowed upon me His blessing: I completely assimilated \\n\\tthe science of number, and with such success that my fellow students\\n\\tat the king\\'s court began to envy me.\\n\\n\\tI spent eight years with Tyukhik and studied many books that had not \\n\\tbeen translated into our language. For the vardapet had an innumerable \\n\\tcollection of books: secret and explicit, ecclesiastical and pagan, \\n\\tbooks on art, history, and medicine, books of chronologies. Why \\n\\tenumerate them by title? In a word, there is no book that Tyukhik did \\n\\tnot have. And he had such a gift from the Holy Spirit for translating\\n\\tthat when he sat down to translate something from the Greek into \\n\\tArmenian, he did not struggle as other translators did, and the \\n\\ttranslation read as if the work were written in that language \\n\\toriginally.\\n\\n\\tTyukhik told me how he had achieved such vast erudition and how he had \\n\\tlearned the Armenian language. \"When I was young,\" he said, \"I lived \\n\\tin Trebizon, at the court of the military chief Ioannus Patricus, and \\n\\tfor a long time, up to the accession of Mauritius to the throne I \\n\\tserved as a military man in Armenia and learned your language and \\n\\tliterature. During one attack by Persian troops on the Greeks, I was \\n\\twounded and escaped to Antioch. I lost all my possessions. Praying to \\n\\tthe Lord to heal my wounds, I made a promise: \"If You prolong my life, \\n\\tI shall dedicate it not to accumulating perishable treasures but to \\n\\tcollecting treasures of knowledge.\" And the Lord heard my prayers. \\n\\tAfter I recovered I went to Jerusalem, and from there to Alexandria \\n\\tand Rome. Upon returning to Constantinople, I met a famous philosopher \\n\\tfrom Athens and studied with him for many years. After that I returned \\n\\tto my homeland and began to teach and instruct my people.\"\\n\\n\\tAfter some years that philosopher died. Not finding a replacement for \\n\\thim, the king and his courtiers sent for Tyukhik and invited him to \\n\\tassume the teacher\\'s position. Tyukhik, citing the promise he made to \\n\\tGod not to move far from the city, turned down the offer. But because\\n\\tof his wide leaning, people came streaming from all countries to study \\n\\twith him.\\n\\n\\tAnd I, the most insignificant of all Armenians, having learned from \\n\\thim this powerful science, desired by kings, brought it to our \\n\\tcountry, supported by no one, obligated only to my own industry, God\\'s \\n\\thelp, and the prayers of the Blessed Educator. And no one thanked me \\n\\tfor my efforts.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProblems and Solutions\\n\\n\\tA half and one sixth and one nine-ninth of all the books were printed\\n\\ton verge\\'; one fifth and one two-hundred-eighty-fifth--on rag paper; \\n\\tone forty-fifth and one eight-hundred-fifty-fifth--on vellum, and \\n\\tforty-five inscribed copies--on Dutch paper. And so, find how many \\n\\tcopies were printed in all.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t--Imitation of Anania of Shirak\\n\\nA Latin proverb says habent sua fata libelli (\"books have their own fate\").\\nThe fate of Problems and Solutions by Anania of Shirak is quite amazing. The\\nmanuscripts of Anania\\'s book were preserved only because, according to \\nArmenian historians, \"in ancient and medieval Armenia manuscripts were guarded \\nfrom invaders, like weapons, and cherished, like one\\'s own children.\" Biding\\ntheir time, the manuscripts lay in the Matenadaran, a renowned depository of \\nancient manuscripts (now the Mesrop Mashtots Institute of Ancient Manuscripts).\\nAnd its hour finally arrived. In 1896 the learned monk Father Kaloust used two \\nmanuscripts to publish the problem book, supplementing it with an introduction \\nand commentary. In 1918 the book was translated into Russian, edited, \\nannotated, and typeset by Iosef Orbeli, a prominent scholar (and later a \\nmember of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR).\\n\\nIn the translator\\'s words, the problems of Anania are \"amusing, full of life, \\nand simple.\" Orbeli goes on to say: \"The subjects of the problems are \\ngenerally taken from everyday life. The scene is predominantly his homeland \\nShirak and the surrounding countryside, and the dramatis personae, if they are \\nnamed, are the local princes--the Kamsarakans, including Nersekh, who was a \\ncontemporary of Anania.\" Like other ancient authors, Anania of Shirak used \\nonly \"aliquots\" -- that is, fractions with a numerator of 1. When it is\\nnecessary to write fractions with numerators other than 1, one has to \\nrepresent it as a sum of aliquots (see the epigraph above).\\n\\nLike any true work of art, the problems of Anania suffer terribly in the \\nretelling. You have to read the originals (albeit in translation) in their \\nfull glory. So let\\'s open Anania\\'s problem book--a gift from across the ages.\\n\\nProblems 1 and 8 relate to the Armenian uprising against the Persians in A.D. \\n572.\\n\\nProblem 1\\n\\nMy father told me the following story. During the famous wars between the \\nArmenians and the Persians, prince Zaurak Kamsarakan performed extraordinary \\nheroic deeds. Three times in a single month he attacked the Persian troops. \\nThe first time, he struck down half of the Persian army. The second time, \\npursuing the Persians, he slaughtered one fourth of the soldiers. The third \\ntime, he destroyed one eleventh of the Persian army. The Persians who were \\nstill alive, numbering two hundred eighty, fled to Nakhichevan. And so, from \\nthis remainder, find how many Persian soldiers there were before the massacre.\\n\\nProblem 8\\n\\nDuring the famous Armenian uprising against the Persians, when Zaurak\\nKamsarakan killed Suren, one of the Armenian azats[4] sent an envoy to the\\nPersian king to report the baleful news. The envoy covered fifty miles in a \\nday. Fifteen days later, when he learned of this, Zaurak Kamsarakan sent \\nriders in pursuit to bring the envoy back. The riders covered eighty miles in \\na day. And so, find how many days it took them to catch the envoy.\\n\\nProblem 18 mentions vessels made of varying amounts of metal. In the Russian \\ntranslation, they are all called \"dishes.\" But in the original Armenian, \\naccording to Orbeli\\'s note, the dishes in the first and second instances are \\ncalled mesur, and in the third instance scutel. Scutel is a common Armenian \\nword, but mesur had not been encountered in Armenian literature before \\nAnania\\'s Problems and Solutions.\\n\\nProblem 18\\n\\nThere was a tray in my house. I melted it down and made other vessels from the \\nmetal. From one third I made a mesur; from one fourth, another mesur; from\\none fifth, two goblets; from one sixth, two scutels; and from two hundred ten \\ndrams, I made a bowl. And now, find the weight of the tray.\\n\\nSeveral of the problems reflect the richness of the Caucasian fauna in \\nAnania\\'s time -- for instance, problem 7.\\n\\nProblem 7\\n\\nOnce I was in Marmet, the capital of the Kamsarakans. Strolling along the bank \\nof the river Akhuryan, I saw a school of fish and ordered that a net be cast. \\nWe caught a half and a quarter of the school, and all the fishes that slipped\\nout of the net ended up in a creel. When I looked in the creel, I found \\nforty-five fishes. And now, find how many fishes here were in all.\\n\\nThe temptation is great to present all 24 problems. But I\\'ll restrain myself\\nand offer you just one more.\\n\\nProblem 20 provides some interesting information about the wild animals that \\ninhabited Armenia at one time but now extinct for so long that there is no\\nmention of them even in zoological reference books. The wild donkey, according \\nto the generally accepted view, never roamed the Armenian lands. Yet Anania of \\nShirak offers evidence to the contrary .\\n\\nProblem 20\\n\\nThe hunting preserve of Nersekh Kamsarakan, ter[5] of Shirak and Asharunik, \\nwas at the base of the mountain called Artin. One night great herds of wild\\ndonkey entered the preserve. The hunters could not cope with the donkeys and, \\nrunning to the village of Talin, told Nersekh about them. When he arrived with\\nhis brothers and azats and entered the preserve, they began killing the wild \\nbeasts. Half of the animals were caught in traps, one fourth were killed by \\narrows. The young, which constituted one twelfth of all the animals, were \\ncaught alive, and three hundred sixty wild donkeys were killed by spears. And \\nso, find how many beasts there were at the start of this massacre.\\n\\n\\t\\t\"Set in type by me, Iosef Orbeli\"\\n\\n\\tHis biography could not be squeezed into the framework of a \\n\\tbibliography.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t-- K Uzbashyan, Academician\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIosef Abgarovich Orbeli\\n\\nAnyone who is lucky enough to hold a copy (1/n of the small printing--n is the \\nsolution to the epigraph in the previous section) of the Russian translation \\nof Anania of Shirak\\'s Problems and Solutions, a thin book with yellowed pages,\\nhas probably noticed the variety of the fonts, the elegance of the borders, \\nand the high quality of the design, printing, and binding. Such great \\nattention to detail is characteristic of works that fulfill a requirement for \\na degree in bookmaking. And this problem book was indeed a kind of diploma \\nattesting to the professional maturity of the man who created it. An \\nadvertisement at the end of the book reads: \"This book was typeset in \\nDecember 1917 at the printing offices of the Russian Academy of Sciences by \\nme, Iosef Orbeli; the text was also proofread, laid out, and decorated with \\nborders by me. Various circumstances prevented me from carrying this project \\nto the end; the final pages of the book were typeset by M. Strolman.\"\\n\\nTypesetting was neither the first nor the only profession of the renowned \\norientalist Iosef Orbeli, who later became the director of the Hermitage \\nMuseum in Leningrad. He was also a cabinetmaker and a locksmith. Orbeli had \\nalready become acquainted with the famous academic printing house Typis \\nAcademiae, founded in 1728 and known all over the scientific world for its \\nrich collection of fonts and its virtuoso typesetters. In preparing to publish \\nthe corpus of ancient inscriptions preserved on the walls of Armenian \\nchurches, Orbeli found it necessary to create a new font that would preserve \\nthe unique signs and ligatures. This complicated work was done by M. G.\\nStrolman. (Unfortunately the entire set of letters was destroyed during the \\nblockade of Leningrad in World War II.)\\n\\nWhen Orbeli came to the printing offices of the Academy of Sciences, times \\nwere hard. The only way to publish the newly translated Problems of Anania\\nwas for Orbeli to learn typesetting (he had always been attracted to the \\nprinter\\'s craft). In 1922 Orbeli became the director of printing at the \\nAcademy of Sciences. Even after he retired, he remained a tireless champion\\nof Russian academic typography.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tBack to Earth\\n\\n\\tThis book by definition does not exhaust all the most important \\n\\tworks in this domain. The editor hopes that those who are guilty \\n\\tof this incompleteness will read these lines and, stung by shame, \\n\\twill work up, if not a collection like this, at least a monograph.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t--V.

This is basically\\na share in the Divine life.  Take a rock and make it able to talk:\\nwhat God does to a human being through sanctifying grace is similar.\\nIt makes such a one able to live on a plane that is above the powers\\nof any possible creature.  This is the \"everlasting life\" that the New\\nTestament speaks of.\\n\\nWhat Christ did when he came was to restore this life of sanctifying\\ngrace to the human race.  He instituted the Sacraments as the means by\\nwhich this life is given to people, and its increase fostered.\\n\\nThe absence of sanctifying grace at death means automatic exclusion\\nfrom Heaven.  The nature of Heaven is such that it\\'s impossible for a\\nhuman being to have any part in it without the gift of sanctifying\\ngrace.  To use my example, it would be like taking that rock and\\nattempting to hold a conversation with it: rocks cannot talk.  Neither\\ncan human beings live in Heaven without sanctifying grace.\\n\\nThis all obviously applies equally well to infants or adults, since\\nboth have souls.  Infants must be baptized, therefore, or they cannot\\nenter into Heaven.  They too need this form of life in them, or they\\ncannot enter into Heaven.\\n\\nTurning it around, infant baptism is good supporting evidence for the\\nCatholic belief in sanctifying grace.  Unless Baptism causes some\\nchange in an infant\\'s soul, there is no particular reason to insist on\\nthe practice.  Yet infant Baptism was probably practiced by the\\nApostles themselves, and was *certainly* part of the Church shortly\\nthereafter.\\n\\nThere is evidence for infant Baptism in the New Testament itself: 1\\nCor 1:16, Acts 16:15, 16:33, 18:8, also Acts 11:14.  It is known for\\nsure that at least one disciple of the Apostle John was baptized as an\\ninfant: St. Polycarp (because of a remark he makes in the acts of his\\nmartyrdom).  St. Justin Martyr mentions men and women baptized as\\ninfants.  There is direct evidence in St.  Irenaeus\\'s \"Against\\nHeresies\", and in Tertullian\\'s \"On Baptism\".  All these so far\\nmentioned are in the first 170 years after our Lord\\'s death.  After\\nthat, there starts to be tons of evidence for the practice.\\n'),\n",

In this post on depression, I\\'m \\nlaying it all out.  I\\'ll continue to post here because I think that I have \\nsome knowledge that could be useful.  Once you have read this post, you \\nshould know where I\\'m coming from when I post again in the future.\\n\\nIn article <123552@netnews.upenn.edu>, lchaplyn@mail.sas.upenn.edu (Lida Chaplynsky) writes:\\n> \\n> A family member of mine is suffering from a severe depression brought on\\n> by menopause as well as a mental break down.

If anyone\\n> can suggest a Philly area nutritionist, or else some literature to read,\\n> I\\'d appreciate it.\\n \\nLida,\\nI can emphasize with your situation.  Both my wife and I suffered from \\nbouts of depression.  Her\\'s was brought on by breast cancer and mine was a \\nrebound stress reaction to her modified radical mastectomy and \\nchemotherapy.  Lida, I used my knowledge of nutrition to get her through \\nher six months of chemotherapy(with the approval of her oncologist).  When \\nsevere depression set in a few months after the chemo stopped, I tried to \\nuse supplements to bring her out of it.  I had \"cured\" her PMS using \\nsupplements and I really thought that I knew enough about the role of diet \\nin depression to take care of her depression as well.  It didn\\'t work and \\nshe was put on Prozac by her oncologist.  Two Winters ago(three years after \\nby wife\\'s breast cancer) I got hit with severe depression(pretty typical and \\none reason why many marriages break up after breast cancer or another \\nstressor).  I tried to take care of it for several months with \\nsupplementation.  Didn\\'t work.  My internist ended up putting me on Prozac. \\nI was going to give you a list of several studies that have been done using \\nB6, niacin, folate and B12 to \"cure\" depression.  I\\'m not going to do that \\nbecause all you would be doing is flying blind like I was.\\n\\nLida, I do believe that depression can have a dietary component.  But the \\nproblem is that you need to know exactly what the problem is and then use \\nan approach which will \"fix\" the problem.  For chemotherapy, I knew exactly \\nwhat drugs were going to be used and exactly what nutrients would be \\naffected.  Same thing for PMS.  I was flying blind for both of these \\nstressors but the literature that I used to devise a treatment program was \\npretty good.  Depression is just too complicated.  What you really need is \\na nutritional scan.  This is not a diet analysis but an analysis of your \\nbodies nutrient reserves.  For every vitamin and mineral(except vitamin C), \\nyou have a reserve.  The RDA is not designed to give you enough of any \\nnutrient to keep these reserves full, it is only designed to keep them from \\nbeing emptied which would cause clinical pathology.  Stress will increase \\nyour need for many vitamins and minerals.  This is when your reserves become \\nvery important.\\n\\nLida, without your permission, I\\'m going to use your post as a conduit to \\ntry to explain to the readers in this group and Sci. Med. where I\\'m coming \\nfrom.  I have taught a course on human nutrition in one of the Osteopathic \\nMedical schools for ten years now.  I\\'ve written my own textbook because \\nnone was available.  What I teach is not a rehash of biochemistry.  I \\npreach nutrient reserves(yes my lectures in this course are referred to by \\nmy students as sermons).  Here is what I cover:\\n\\nIndroduction and Carbohydrates \\t\\t\\tLipids\\n\\nProteins I\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tProteins II\\n\\nEnergy Balance\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tEvaluation of Nutritional\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tStatus I, A Clinical \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPerspective\\n\\nEvaluation of Nutritional Status II,            Evaluation of Nutritional\\t\\t\\nA Biochemical Perspective\\t\\t\\tStatus III, Homework \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAssignment Using the \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tNutritionist IV Diet and \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFitness Analysis Software \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tprogram\\n\\nWeight Control\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFood Fads and Facts\\n\\nAge-Related Change in Nutrient Requirements\\tFood Additives, \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tContaminants and Cancer\\n\\nDrug-Nutrient Interactions\\t\\t\\tMineral and Water Balance\\n\\nSodium, Potassium and Chloride\\t\\t\\tCalcium, Magnesium and \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPhosphorus\\n\\nIron\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tZinc and Copper\\n\\nIodine and Fluoride\\t\\t\\t\\tOther Trace Minerals\\n\\nVitamin A\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tVitamin E\\n\\nVitamins D and K\\t\\t\\t\\tVitamin C\\n\\nThiamin and Niacin\\t\\t\\t\\tRiboflavin and Pyridoxine\\n\\nPantothenic and Folic acids\\t\\t\\tBiotin and B12\\n\\nOther Nutrient Factors\\t\\t\\t\\tEnteral Nutrition\\n\\nParenteral Nutrition\\n\\nEvery three years I spend my entire Summer reviewing the Medical literature \\nto find material that I can use in my nutrition textbook.  I last did this \\nin the Summer of 1991.  I read everything that I can find and then sit down \\nand rewrite my lecture handouts which are bound in three separate books \\nthat have 217, 237 and 122 pages.  Opposite each page of written text(which \\nI write myself) I\\'ve pulled figures, tables and graphs from various \\ncopyrighted sources.  Since this material is only being used for \\neducational purposes, I can get around the copyright laws (so far).  I can not \\nsend this material out to newsgroup readers(as I\\'ve been asked to do).\\n\\nI am now in the process of trying to get a grant to setup a nutrition \\nassessment lab.  This is the last peice of the nutrition puzzle that I need \\nto make my education program complete.  This lab will let me measure the \\nnutrient reserve for almost all the vitamins and minerals that are known to \\nbe required in humans.  The Mayo clinic already uses a similiar lab to \\ndesign supplement programs for their cancer patients.  Cancer Treatment \\nCenters of America, which is a private for-profit organization with \\nhospitals in Illinois and Oklahoma(Tulsa) also operates a \\nnutritional assessment clinical lab.  I also believe that the Pritikin \\nClinic in California has a similiar lab setup.\\n\\nFor physicians reading this post, I would suggest that you get the new \\nClinical Nutrition Textbook that has just been published(Feb) by Mosby.  I \\nhave been using Alpers Manual of Nutritional Therapeutics(a Little Brown \\nseries book) as a supplemental text for my course but Alpers is geared more \\nto residency training.  Two M.D\\'s have written this new Clinical Nutrition\\ntextbook and it is geared more towards medical student education and it \\ndoes a good job of covering the lab tests that can be run to assess a \\npatient\\'s nutritional status.  Let me quote a few sentences from the \\nPreface of this new text:\\n\\n\"So-called nutrition specialists were in reality gastroenterologists, \\nhematologists, or pediatricians who just happened to profess some knowledge \\nof nutrition as it related to their field of practice.\"  \\n\\n\"Unfortunately, about two thirds of the medical schools in the United \\nStates require no formal instruction in nutrition.\"\\n\\n\"But times and medical practice have changed.  More than half of the \\nleading causes of death in this country are nutrition related.\"\\n\\n\"... this monograph should accomplish the following two objectives: (1) it \\nshould complement your medical training by emphasizing the relevance of \\nnutrition to your medical practice; and (2) it should heighten your \\nawareness of nutrition as a medical speciality that is vitally important \\nfor both disease prevention and the treatment of diseases of essentially \\nevery organ system.\"\\n\\nRoland L. Weinsier, MD, DrPH \\n\\nLida, my advise to you is that you tell your family members to try to find \\na physician who has an understanding of the role that vitamins and minerals\\n(yes even magnesium may play a role in depression) play in depression and \\nwho could get a nutritional profile run.  Menopause is often a time when \\nwomen suffer depression.  There are a lot of hormonal changes that are \\noccuring but they are not the same ones that occur during PMS.  A \\nnutritionist may also be able to help.  Not too long ago a poster mentioned \\nthat his nutritionist had diagnosed a selenium deficiency based on a red \\ncell glutathionine peroxidase test(the specific test for the selenium \\nreserve).  Most clinical labs will not run this test and I advised him to \\ntry to make sure that the lab that did the test was certified.  There are \\nalso a lot of hair and nail analysis labs setup to do trace mineral \\nanalysis but these labs are not regulated.  Checks of these labs using \\ncertified standards, and also those doing water lead analysis, showed some \\npretty shoddy testing was going on.  If you or anyone else finds someone \\nwho will run these speciality nutrition tests, make sure that they are \\nusing a lab that has been certified under CLIA(the Clinical Laboratory \\nImprovement Act).  \\n\\nA diet analysis may be helpful since many nutrient reserves have been shown \\nto correlate fairly well with the dietary intake as monitored by food logging \\nand software analysis(Nutritionist IV and other software programs).  But \\nthere are still about half of the nutrients required by humans that do not \\nshow a very good correlation between apparent dietary intake and reserve status.\\nUntil we have more nutritional assessment clinical labs in operation in the \\nU.S. and physicians who have been trained how to use the nutritional \\nprofile that these labs provide to devise a treatment approach that uses \\ndiet changes and supplementation, anti-depressants will probably continue \\nto be the best approach to depression.\\n\\nMartin Banschbach, Ph.D.\\nProfessor of Biochemistry and Chairman\\nDepartment of Biochemistry and Microbiology\\nOSU College of Osteopathic Medicine\\n\\n\"Without discourse, there is no remembering, without remembering, there is \\nno learning, without learning, there is only ignorance.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'),\n",

Fundamental human rights, such as the right to life, to\\neducation, to establish a family and have children, to human\\ndignity, the right to free movement, to free expression, etc. are\\nmore important to human existence that the rights of states.\\n\\n2.      In the event of a conflict between basic human rights and\\nrights of collectivities, basic human rights should prevail.\\n\\n3.      Between the collectivities defining themselves as\\nJewish-Israeli and Palestinian-Arab, however labelled, an\\nunresolved conflict exists.\\n\\n4.      This conflict has caused great sufferings for millions of\\npeople. It moreover poisons relations between communities, peoples\\nand nations.\\n\\n5.      Each year, the United States expends billions of dollars\\nin economic and military aid to the conflicting parties.\\n\\n6.      Attempts to solve the Israeli-Arab conflict by traditional\\npolitical means have failed.\\n\\n7.      As long as the conflict is perceived as that between two\\ndistinct ethnical/religious communities/peoples which claim the\\nland, there is no just nor peaceful solution possible.\\n\\n8.      Love between human beings can be capitalized for the sake\\nof peace and justice. When people love, they share.\\n\\nHaving stated my assumptions, I will now state my proposal.\\n\\n1.      A Fund should be established which would disburse grants\\nfor each child born to a couple where one partner is Israeli-Jew\\nand the other Palestinian-Arab.\\n\\n2.      To be entitled for a grant, a couple will have to prove\\nthat one of the partners possesses or is entitled to Israeli\\ncitizenship under the Law of Return and the other partner,\\nalthough born in areas under current Isreali control, is not\\nentitled to such citizenship under the Law of Return.\\n\\n3.      For the first child, the grant will amount to $18.000. For\\nthe second the third child, $12.000 for each child. For each\\nsubsequent child, the grant will amount to $6.000 for each child.\\n\\n\\n4.      The Fund would be financed by a variety of sources which\\nhave shown interest in promoting a peaceful solution to the\\nIsraeli-Arab conflict, including the U.S. Government, Jewish and\\nChristian organizations in the U.S.  and a great number of\\ngovernments and international organizations.\\n\\n5.      The emergence of a considerable number of 'mixed'\\nmarriages in Israel/Palestine, all of whom would have relatives on\\n'both sides' of the divide, would make the conflict lose its\\nethnical and unsoluble core and strengthen the emergence of a\\ntruly civil society. The existence of a strong 'mixed' stock of\\npeople would also help the integration of Israeli society into the\\nMiddle-East in a graceful manner.\\n\\nObjections to this proposal will certainly be voiced. I will\\nattempt to identify some of these:\\n\\n1.      The idea of providing financial incentives to selected\\nforms of partnership and marriage, is not conventional. However,\\nit is based on the concept of affirmative action, which is\\nrecognized as a legitimate form of public policy to reverse the\\nperverse effects of segregation and discrimination. International\\nlaw clearly permits affirmative action when it is aimed at\\nreducing racial discrimination and segregation.\\n\\n2.      It may be objected that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict\\nis not primarily a religious or ethnical conflict, but that it is\\na conflict between a colonialist settler society and an indigenous\\ncolonized society that can only regain its freedom by armed\\nstruggle. This objection is based on the assumption that the\\n'enemy' is not Zionism as ideology and practice, but\\nIsraeli-Jewish society and its members which will have to be\\ndefeated. This objection has no merit because it does not fulfill\\nthe first two assumptions concerning the primacy of fundamental\\nhuman rights over collective rights (see above)\\n\\n3.      Fundamentalist Jews would certainly object to the use of\\nfinancial incentives to encourage 'mixed marriages'. From their\\npoint of view, the continued existence of a specific Jewish People\\noverrides any other consideration, be it human love, peace of\\nhuman rights.  The President of the World Jewish Congress, Edgar\\nBronfman, reflected this view a few years ago in an interview he\\ngave to Der Spiegel, a German magazine. He called the increasing\\nassimilation of Jews in the world a <calamity>, comparable in its\\neffects only with the Holocaust. This objection has no merit\\neither because it does not fulfill the first two assumptions (see\\nabove)\\n\\n4.      It may objected that only a few people in\\nIsrael/Palestine, would request such grants and that it would thus\\nnot serve its purpose. To this objection one might respond that\\nalthough it is not possible to determine with certainty the effect\\nof such a proposal, the existence of such a Fund would help mixed\\ncouples to resist the pressure of their respective societies and\\nencourage young couples to reject fundamentalist and racist\\nattitudes.\\n\\n5.      It may objected that such a Fund would need great sums to\\nbring about substantial demographic changes. This objection has\\nmerits. However, it must be remembered that huge sums, more than\\n$3 billion, are expended each year by the United States government\\nand by U.S. organizations to maintain an elusive peace in the\\nMiddle-East through armaments. A mere fraction of these sums would\\nsuffice to launch the above proposal and create a more favorable\\nclimate towards the existence of 'mixed' marriages in\\nIsrael/Palestine, thus encouraging the emergence of a\\nnon-segregated society in that worn-torn land.\\n\\nI would be thankful for critical comments to the above proposal as\\nwell for any dissemination of this proposal for meaningful\\ndiscussion and enrichment.\\n\\nElias Davidsson Post Box 1760 121 Reykjavik, ICELAND\\n\\n\"),\n",

There were literally thousands\\n  of incidents continuously until World War I, in Southeastern Europe as far\\n  west and north as Monastir and Kavalla, in Istanbul, at Gallipoli and\\n  the Dardanelles, at Salonica, and in all the Arab provinces as far south\\n  as Damascus and Beirut and in Egypt at Cairo and Alexandria. These\\n  invariably resulted from accusations spread among Ottoman Christians\\n  by word of mouth, or published in their newspapers, often by Christian\\n  financiers and merchants anxious to get their Jewish competitors out of\\n  the way or to divert onto the Jews Muslim anger at reports of Christian\\n  massacres of Muslims in Southeastern Europe or Central Asia, resulting\\n  in individual and mob attacks on Jews, and the burning of their shops\\n  and homes.\\n\\n  Individual experiences were horrible. Jews constantly went in fear of\\n  Armenian or Greek attacks in the streets of Ottoman cities. In Egypt\\n  and Syria, it was usually the Greeks who led the way, in many cases\\n  with the assistance of local Armenians and Syrian Christians, whose\\n  Greek, Arabic and French-language newspapers often printed all the\\n  rumors they could find regarding Jews, evidently with the desire of\\n  instigating violence. The Syrian Arab Christians in particular spread\\n  their long-standing anti-Semitic hatreds from Syria to Egypt, where\\n  their monopoly of the local press and their espousal of popular causes\\n  such as Egyptian nationalism and opposition to the British rule, enabled\\n  them to spread their anti-Jewish message among the Muslim masses with\\n  little question or opposition.\\n\\n  On 20 June 1890, thus, Sir Evelyn Baring (later Lord Cromer), British\\n  High Commissioner in Egypt, received the following report from David\\n  and Nissim Ades, in Cairo:\\n\\n    \\'\\'Sir,\\n\\n      I beg sir to draw to your attention to the violent articles which\\n      has (sic) appeared in an Arabic paper called El Mahroussa which\\n      contained nothing but lies and false accusations against the Jews,\\n      especially those (the issues) of the 14th, 17th and 19th instant.\\n      Now, Sir, are we to have here an anti-Semitic party amidst fanaticism,\\n      Greeks, Armenians, etc., or is he to be allowed to continue to poison\\n      the people\\'s minds with exaggeration and painted words?

I also do not try to force you to accept my rules.\\n\\nBecause:\\nSimply because you don\\'t like what other people are doing doesn\\'t give you\\nthe right to stop it, Hudson.  We are all aware that you would like for \\neveryone to be like you.  However, it is obnoxious, arrogant thinking like \\nyours, the \"I-know-I\\'m-morally-right-so-I-can-force-it-on-you\" bullshit \\nthat has brought us religious wars, pogroms against Jews, gay-bashing,\\nand other atrocities by other people who, like you, \"knew\" they were\\nmorally right.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(me)\\n>What is it with you, Hudson?

Aren\\'t you telling me it is wrong for me to do that? \\n\\nIt is not a moral standard that I am presenting you with, Hudson.  It is\\na key to getting along in life with other people.  It is also a point of\\nrespect:  I trust other people to be intelligent enough to make their\\nown choices, and I expect the same to be returned.  You, on the other\\nhand, do not trust them, and want to make the choice for them--whether\\nthey like it or not.\\n\\nIt is also a way to avoid an inconsistency:  if you believe that you have \\nthe right to set moral standards for others and interfere in their lives, \\nthen you must, by logic, admit that other people have the same right of \\ninterference in your life.  \\n(Yes, I know; you will say that your religion is correct and tells you that\\nonly agents acting in behalf of your religion have the right of interference.\\nHowever, other people will say that you have misinterpreted the Word of\\nGod and that *they* are the actual true believers, and that you are\\nacting on your own authority.  And so it goes).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(hudson)\\n/Who gave\\n/you the authority to set such a moral standard for me to tell me that I \\n/cannot set a moral standard for others?\\n\\n\\nYou can set all the standards that you want, actually.  But don\\'t be surprised\\nif people don\\'t follow you like rats after the Pied Piper.  \\n\\nAt the most basic form, I am not going to LET you tell me what to do;\\nand if necessary, I will beat you to a bloody pulp before I let you actually\\ninterfere in my life.\\n\\nNow, at a more humane level than that, I recognize that all people are\\nsentient beings possessed of intelligence and capable of reason.

But if you look at Collosions,\\nwithout going into it with the assumption that the Sabbath cannot be \\na ceremonial law, you will see that it does refer to the sabbath.\\n\\nPaul writes in Collosions 2:14-17 how that Christ nailed the laws that were\\nagainst us to His cross, and therefore we should not be judged in what\\nwhat food we eat, what we drink, the keeping of new moons and holy days,\\nor the keeping of the sabbath.\\n\\nThe word for sabbath in this verse is \"sabbaton\" and is used throughout the\\nNew Testament to refer to the 7th day.  If there is any Scripture from\\nwhich we get the idea of the ceremonial law, this is one of them, and the\\nsabbath is listed among the ceremonial laws.\\n\\nIf one goes into this with the fundamental assumption \"the sabbath cannot\\nbe a ceremonial law\" then he will have to find some way around it, like\\nsaying that this can only refer to the other sabbath holy days besides the\\n7tH day, Because \"the sabbath cannot be a ceremonial law.\"  But\\nPaul is very careful in his letters to add some kind of parenthetcal \\nstatement if there is anything that can be seen as a liscence to sin\\nin his writings.\\n\\nAlso, why is the sabbath absent from the epistles (except for Hebrews 4, which\\ntalks about the rest that comes through faith?)  Surely it would have\\nbeen a big problem for first century Christians living in a society\\nthat did not rest on the 7th day.  Especially slaves. Many new converst were\\nslaves.  It would have been difficult for slaves to rest on the sabbath\\nif it had been mandatory.  Why is there no mention of this in the epistles?\\n\\nLink Hudson.\\n'),\n",

Hardin\\n\\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                              April 15, 1993\\n#1506\\n\\n     Scientists at NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory report the\\nsuccessful flight of a balloon carrying instruments designed to\\nmeasure and study chemicals in the Earth\\'s ozone layer.\\n\\n     The April 3 flight from California\\'s Barstow/Daggett Airport\\nreached an altitude of 37 kilometers (121,000 feet) and took\\nmeasurements as part of a program established to correlate data\\nwith the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS).  \\n\\n     The data from the balloon flight will also be compared to\\nreadings from the Atmospheric Trace Molecular Spectroscopy\\n(ATMOS) experiment which is currently flying onboard the shuttle\\nDiscovery.\\n\\n     \"We launch these balloons several times a year as part of an\\nongoing ozone research program.  In fact, JPL is actively\\ninvolved in the study of ozone and the atmosphere in three\\nimportant ways,\" said Dr. Jim Margitan, principal investigator on\\nthe balloon research campaign.  \\n\\n     \"There are two JPL instruments on the UARS satellite,\" he\\ncontinued.  \"The ATMOS experiment is conducted by JPL scientists,\\nand the JPL balloon research provides collaborative ground truth\\nfor those activities, as well as data that is useful in its own\\nright.\"\\n\\n     The measurements taken by the balloon payload will add more\\npieces to the complex puzzle of the atmosphere, specifically the\\nmid-latitude stratosphere during winter and spring. \\nUnderstanding the chemistry occurring in this region helps\\nscientists construct more accurate computer models which are\\ninstrumental in predicting future ozone conditions.\\n\\n     The scientific balloon payload consisted of three JPL\\ninstruments:  an ultraviolet ozone photometer which measures\\nozone as the balloon ascends and descends through the atmosphere;\\na submillimeterwave limb sounder which looks at microwave\\nradiation emitted by molecules in the atmosphere; and a Fourier\\ntransform infrared interferometer which monitors how the\\natmosphere absorbs sunlight. \\n\\n     Launch occurred at about noontime, and following a three-\\nhour ascent, the balloon floated eastward at approximately 130\\nkilometers per hour (70 knots).  Data was radioed to ground\\nstations and recorded onboard.  The flight ended at 10 p.m.\\nPacific time in eastern New Mexico when the payload was commanded\\nto separate from the balloon.\\n\\n     \"We needed to fly through sunset to make the infrared\\nmeasurements,\" Margitan explained, \"and we also needed to fly in\\ndarkness to watch how quickly some of the molecules disappear.\"\\n\\n     It will be several weeks before scientists will have the\\ncompleted results of their experiments.  They will then forward\\ntheir data to the UARS central data facility at the Goddard Space\\nFlight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland for use by the UARS\\nscientists.    \\n\\n     The balloon was launched by the National Scientific Balloon\\nFacility, normally based in Palestine, Tex., operating under a\\ncontract from NASA\\'s Wallops Flight Facility.  The balloon was\\nlaunched in California because of the west-to-east wind direction\\nand the desire to keep the operation in the southwest.\\n\\n     The balloons are made of 20-micron (0.8 mil, or less than\\none-thousandth of an inch) thick plastic, and are 790,000 cubic\\nmeters (28 million cubic feet) in volume when fully inflated with\\nhelium (120 meters (400 feet) in diameter).  The balloons weigh\\nbetween 1,300 and 1,800 kilograms (3,000 and 4,000 pounds).  The\\nscientific payload weighs about 1,300 kilograms (3,000) pounds\\nand is 1.8 meters (six feet) square by 4.6 meters (15 feet) high.\\n\\n     The JPL balloon research is sponsored by NASA\\'s Upper\\nAtmosphere Research Program and the UARS Correlative Measurements\\nProgram.                        \\n\\n                              #####\\n     ___    _____     ___\\n    /_ /|  /____/ \\\\  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov\\n    | | | |  __ \\\\ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab |\\n ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | Being cynical never helps \\n/___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | to correct the situation \\n|_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | and causes more aggravation\\n                                                  | instead.\\n'),\n",

I won\\'t start\\npanicking until/unless DES or RSA or stuff like that is prohibited, but\\nI\\'m a little anxious.  (No doubt it won\\'t be long before someone posts\\nexplaining how this just a small part of some far-ranging and\\nlong-lived NSA-PKP-IRS-FBI-CIA-HandgunControlInc-Clinton conspiracy to\\nsubvert freedom, democracy, and mathematics.)  My feeling is that the\\nadministration probably isn\\'t that worried about things like DES and\\nRSA and PGP and RIPEM, since they\\'ll never be used by a group much\\nwider than us computer geeks.\\n\\nThe fact that this just came out now suggests one of two things:\\n\\n1.  The NSA has been working on this for a long time, and it only just\\n    now happened to be ``ready\\'\\' to release to the world at this time.\\n\\n2.  The NSA has been working on this for a long time, but wasn\\'t able\\n    to get the Bush administration to go along with this plan.  (I\\n    find it unlikely that this would have been because of a sympathy\\n    for the unescrowed use of cryptography; more likely the\\n    administration felt that even escrowed, secret-algorithm and, for\\n    all we know, trivially breakable cryptography should not be made\\n    widely available.)\\n\\nThus said clipper@csrc.ncsl.nist.gov (Clipper Chip Announcement):\\n>This new technology will help companies protect proprietary\\n>information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations\\n>and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted\\n>electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the\\n>ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to\\n>intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. \\n\\nThe majority of the discussion involving this \"Clipper Chip\" seems to\\npertain to the encryption of telephone conversations.  Does anyone\\nknow if that means this chip is designed to work primarily with analog\\nsignals?  The language sort of suggests this, but it\\'s hard to say.\\n\\nThe main thing I just don\\'t get is whether this chip implements\\nsymmetric or asymmetric cryptographic techniques.  Anybody know?\\n\\nI\\'m guessing symmetric, but they don\\'t get very clear about it.  If it\\nis symmetric, how is it useful for anything other than link-level\\nencryption with an identical chip at each end?  How can you negotiate\\na per-session key using symmetric cryptography without using a trusted\\nthird party who knows your key?  (Or does it even use a per-session\\nkey?)\\n\\nIf it\\'s asymmetric, what about PKP\\'s patents, which they claim cover\\nall methods of doing asymmetric cryptography?  Are they getting\\nroyalties, or is hiding infringement the real reason for keeping the\\nalgorithm secret? :-)\\n--\\nMarc VanHeyningen   mvanheyn@cs.indiana.edu   MIME & RIPEM accepted\\nKirk:  I won\\'t hurt you.\\nAlien: You hit me!\\nKirk:  Well, I won\\'t hit you again.\\n'),\n",

It is a fact that Regan and Bush sold arms\\nto Iran, it is also a fact that they supported and armed Iraq.\\n\\nStill this is state dept propaganda so none too surprizing.\\n\\n|>   India\\'s papers weighed the pros and cons of helping the West to\\n|>identify Pakistan\\'s role in promoting terrorism, noting on the one\\n|>hand that doing so could \"bring ruination to Islamabad\\'s Kashmir\\n|>cause\" but, on the other, could also bring India\\'s security apparatus\\n|>uncomfortably close to the CIA and the Mossad.  Arab papers continued\\n|>to portray Iraq and Libya as being unfairly treated by the UN while\\n|>Israel remains unpunished for resolutions which it has violated.\\n\\nIn the case of Lybia there is the problem that the US only decided\\nthat Gadffii ordered the bombing after it needed to make peace with\\ndamascus during the gulf war. One day the US is certain that its Syria,\\nthe next Lybia. For a strange reason the US will not provide evidence to\\nLybian courts for extradition proceedings. Faced with similar demands the\\nUSA would reject them as would any other country.\\n\\n\\n|>   Concerning Northern Ireland, President Clinton\\'s message of\\n|>consolation to the victims of the Warrington bombing was seen in\\n|>British tabloids as signalling a tougher stance by the American\\n|>government against violence by the IRA.\\n\\nThe word is \"terrorism\".\\n\\n\\nThe problem is that after the behaviour of George Bush the USA has an\\nimage abroad as doing precisely what it likes and is in its own interests\\nthen comming out with a Dysney scripted sugary justification repeating a\\nfitting combination of the words \"freedom\" \"dignity\" \"democaracy\" or\\nof \"terrorism\" \"dictatorship\" etc as appropriate.\\n\\nThe USA could go quite far to mend the bridges with  Iran. The people there are\\nrather pissed off because the USA first supported the Shah who they\\nloathed and then supported Saddam when he mounted an unprovoked attack. \\nHardly surprizing after the embassy hostage crisis but Iran is meant to be\\nthe country run by unreasonable bigots not the USA so if there is to be\\nmovement it would be easier for the USA to move.\\n\\nFirst off they could recognise Iraqu\\'s responsibility in initiating the\\nIran/Iraq war. Providing technical assistance to Iran to get it\\'s oil\\nproduction back up to capacity would also be a smart move, at the moment \\nIran is above it\\'s OPEC ceiling. If they had extra capacity they would\\nuse it and bring down the oild price further which is in our interests.\\n\\nThe Iranian clerics would have an interest in seeking a raprochment \\nsimply because a permanent war footing is debilitating. They also need\\nwestern technology. \\n\\n\\nPhill Hallam-Baker\\n'),\n",

The parts are\\nmostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest.\\nWe don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask.\\nNotes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.\\n\\nThe sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu \\nas /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography \\nFAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers \\nevery 21 days.\\n\\n\\n\\nContents:\\n\\n* What is cryptology? Cryptography? Plaintext? Ciphertext? Encryption? Key?\\n* What references can I start with to learn cryptology?\\n* How does one go about cryptanalysis?\\n* What is a brute-force search and what is its cryptographic relevance?\\n* What are some properties satisfied by every strong cryptosystem?\\n* If a cryptosystem is theoretically unbreakable, then is it\\n  guaranteed analysis-proof in practice?\\n* Why are many people still using cryptosystems that are\\n  relatively easy to break?\\n\\n\\n* What is cryptology? Cryptography? Plaintext? Ciphertext? Encryption? Key?\\n\\n  The story begins: When Julius Caesar sent messages to his trusted\\n  acquaintances, he didn't trust the messengers. So he replaced every A\\n  by a C, every B by a D, and so on through the alphabet. Only someone\\n  who knew the ``shift by 2'' rule could decipher his messages.\\n\\n  A cryptosystem or cipher system is a method of disguising messages so\\n  that only certain people can see through the disguise. Cryptography is\\n  the art of creating and using cryptosystems. Cryptanalysis is the art\\n  of breaking cryptosystems---seeing through the disguise even when\\n  you're not supposed to be able to. Cryptology is the study of both\\n  cryptography and cryptanalysis.\\n\\n  The original message is called a plaintext. The disguised message is\\n  called a ciphertext. Encryption means any procedure to convert\\n  plaintext into ciphertext. Decryption means any procedure to convert\\n  ciphertext into plaintext.\\n\\n  A cryptosystem is usually a whole collection of algorithms. The\\n  algorithms are labelled; the labels are called keys. For instance,\\n  Caesar probably used ``shift by n'' encryption for several different\\n  values of n. It's natural to say that n is the key here.\\n\\n  The people who are supposed to be able to see through the disguise are\\n  called recipients. Other people are enemies, opponents, interlopers,\\n  eavesdroppers, or third parties.\\n\\n* What references can I start with to learn cryptology?\\n\\n  For an introduction to technical matter, the survey articles given\\n  in part 10 are the best place to begin as they are, in general,\\n  concise, authored by competent people, and well written. However,\\n  these articles are mostly concerned with cryptology as it has\\n  developed in the last 50 years or so, and are more abstract and\\n  mathematical than historical. The Codebreakers by Kahn [KAH67] is\\n  encyclopedic in its history and technical detail of cryptology up\\n  to the mid-60's.\\n\\n  Introductory cryptanalysis can be learned from Gaines [GAI44] or\\n  Sinkov [SIN66]. This is recommended especially for people who want\\n  to devise their own encryption algorithms since it is a common\\n  mistake to try to make a system before knowing how to break one.\\n\\n  The selection of an algorithm for the DES drew the attention of\\n  many public researchers to problems in cryptology. Consequently\\n  several textbooks and books to serve as texts have appeared. The\\n  book of Denning [DEN82] gives a good introduction to a broad range\\n  of security including encryption algorithms, database security,\\n  access control, and formal models of security. Similar comments\\n  apply to the books of Price & Davies [PRI84] and Pfleeger [PFL89].\\n\\n  The books of Konheim [KON81] and Meyer & Matyas [MEY82] are quite\\n  technical books. Both Konheim and Meyer were directly involved in\\n  the development of DES, and both books give a thorough analysis of\\n  DES. Konheim's book is quite mathematical, with detailed analyses\\n  of many classical cryptosystems. Meyer and Matyas concentrate on\\n  modern cryptographic methods, especially pertaining to key management\\n  and the integration of security facilities into computer systems and\\n  networks.\\n\\n  The books of Rueppel [RUE86] and Koblitz [KOB89] concentrate on\\n  the application of number theory and algebra to cryptography.\\n\\n* How does one go about cryptanalysis?\\n\\n  Classical cryptanalysis involves an interesting combination of\\n  analytical reasoning, application of mathematical tools, pattern\\n  finding, patience, determination, and luck. The best available\\n  textbooks on the subject are the Military Cryptanalytics series\\n  [FRIE1]. It is clear that proficiency in cryptanalysis is, for\\n  the most part, gained through the attempted solution of given\\n  systems. Such experience is considered so valuable that some of the\\n  cryptanalyses performed during WWII by the Allies are still\\n  classified.\\n\\n  Modern public-key cryptanalysis may consist of factoring an integer,\\n  or taking a discrete logarithm. These are not the traditional fare\\n  of the cryptanalyst. Computational number theorists are some of the\\n  most successful cryptanalysts against public key systems.\\n\\n* What is a brute-force search and what is its cryptographic relevance?\\n\\n  In a nutshell: If f(x) = y and you know y and can compute f, you can\\n  find x by trying every possible x. That's brute-force search.\\n\\n  Example: Say a cryptanalyst has found a plaintext and a corresponding\\n  ciphertext, but doesn't know the key. He can simply try encrypting the\\n  plaintext using each possible key, until the ciphertext matches---or\\n  decrypting the ciphertext to match the plaintext, whichever is faster.\\n  Every well-designed cryptosystem has such a large key space that this\\n  brute-force search is impractical.\\n    \\n  Advances in technology sometimes change what is considered\\n  practical. For example, DES, which has been in use for over 10 years\\n  now, has 2^56, or about 10^17, possible keys. A computation with\\n  this many operations was certainly unlikely for most users in the\\n  mid-70's. The situation is very different today given the dramatic\\n  decrease in cost per processor operation. Massively parallel\\n  machines threaten the security of DES against brute force search.\\n  Some scenarios are described by Garron and Outerbridge [GAR91].\\n\\n  One phase of a more sophisticated cryptanalysis may involve a\\n  brute-force search of some manageably small space of possibilities.\\n\\n* What are some properties satisfied by every strong cryptosystem?\\n\\n  The security of a strong system resides with the secrecy of the key\\n  rather than with an attempt to keep the algorithm itself secret.\\n\\n  A strong cryptosystem has a large keyspace, as mentioned above.  The\\n  unicity distance is a measure which gives the minimum amount of\\n  ciphertext that must be intercepted to uniquely identify the key and\\n  if for some key, the unicity distance is much longer than the amount\\n  of ciphertext you intend to encrypt under that key, the system is\\n  probably strong.\\n\\n  A strong cryptosystem will certainly produce ciphertext which appears\\n  random to all standard statistical tests (see, for example, [CAE90]).\\n    \\n  A strong cryptosystem will resist all known previous attacks. A\\n  system which has never been subjected to scrutiny is suspect.\\n\\n  If a system passes all the tests mentioned above, is it necessarily\\n  strong? Certainly not. Many weak cryptosystems looked good at first.\\n  However, sometimes it is possible to show that a cryptosystem is\\n  strong by mathematical proof. ``If Joe can break this system, then\\n  he can also solve the well-known difficult problem of factoring\\n  integers.'' See part 6.  Failing that, it's a crap shoot.\\n\\n* If a cryptosystem is theoretically unbreakable, then is it\\n  guaranteed analysis-proof in practice?\\n\\n  Cryptanalytic methods include what is known as ``practical\\n  cryptanalysis'': the enemy doesn't have to just stare at your\\n  ciphertext until he figures out the plaintext. For instance, he might\\n  assume ``cribs''---stretches of probable plaintext. If the crib is\\n  correct then he might be able to deduce the key and then decipher the\\n  rest of the message. Or he might exploit ``isologs''---the same\\n  plaintext enciphered in several cryptosystems or several keys. Thus\\n  he might obtain solutions even when cryptanalytic theory says he\\n  doesn't have a chance.\\n\\n  Sometimes, cryptosystems malfunction or are misused. The one-time pad,\\n  for example, loses all security if it is used more than once! Even\\n  chosen-plaintext attacks, where the enemy somehow feeds plaintext into\\n  the encryptor until he can deduce the key, have been employed. See\\n  [KAH67].\\n  \\n* Why are many people still using cryptosystems that are\\n  relatively easy to break?\\n\\n  Some don't know any better. Often amateurs think they can design\\n  secure systems, and are not aware of what an expert cryptanalyst\\n  could do. And sometimes there is insufficient motivation for anybody\\n  to invest the work needed to crack a system.\\n\"),\n",

This precludes real-time decrypting of a\\n\\tconversation but that isn\\'t one of the STATED requirements.\\n\\nObservation:\\n\\tIn order for any secure by \"tap-able\" communication scheme to work,\\n\\tthe active parts need to share a secret. And if this secret is\\n\\trevealed, communications by those that know the secret can be made\\n\\t\"un-tap-able\". Obvious candidates are the cryptographic algorithm\\n\\tand the master (family) key.

Even though publicly they say that they support the Greek\\ncause, practically they not only do nothing, but instead, using some usual\\n\"reasoning\" and other crap rhetoric as a pretext, they gradually\\nbackup Kemal (who had given now to the British \"water and bread\" that\\nhe will dissolve the superethnic Ottoman and contract it into a small\\nethnic-state). The main drive behind this British switch was the plan\\nto keep a Muslim state in the region as buffer against a Russian expansion\\ninto warm-water facilities. The \"greek empire\" being an Orthodox Christian\\nstate was too prone to become Russian client.\\n\\nOut of this intrigue, the current state of affairs was established on our\\nlands. While Venizelos and Kemal were promoted as true \"Giants\" by the\\nBritish, since they worked to realize their goals in the region.\\nUnder the same plan, currently Greece and Turkey are recipients of big\\nmilitary funds from the US; both they are functioning as anti-Russian\\nbuffers, while simultaneously both remain good clients of State Dept. because\\notherwise the use of terror of changing \"the balance of power in the Aegean\"\\nwill be used.\\n\\nUnder the same exact rational you should see the Cyprus problem.\\n\\nGr\\n\\nPS: I don\\'t make any anti-...whatever rhetoric. This is the situation\\n    in our region and needs to be said. The previously mentioned powers\\n    are not anything special; they are fucntioning the same way which\\n    anyone else functions all throughout history.

It is still legal to use lethal force (such as a firearm) to\\n   protect life, also contrary to what the officer told me.  Guns\\n   must be stored locked up and unloaded, however.\\n3. Regarding hi-capacity magazines, it is still not clear who will\\n   be exempt or how this will be managed.  This is up to each province.\\n   The general idea is that exempt persons will receive a letter/form\\n   authorizing them to possess the high capacity magazines.  \\n   Apparently, the authorization is to specify how many of these\\n   'prohibited weapons' you will be allowed to possess.  Dealers will\\n   be allowed to order high capacity mags for those allowed to possess\\n   them, but will not be allowed to stock them.\\n4. High capacity magazines converted to comply with the new limits will\\n   not be considered prohibited weapons.  Amendments to the regulations\\n   specify some possible methods to alter the magazines.  Some \\n   manufacturers (Beretta) will be marketing reduced capacity magazines.\\n   (God knows how much they'll charge for these)\\n\\nThis covers most of what we discussed.

As you know, there are 2 kinds of i18n implementation from MIT\\'s \\nX11R5 release -- Xsi and Ximp. Our original implementation of the toolkit\\nuses Xsi.\\n\\nOur toolkit manages each character\\'s size based on our own font management system.\\nIn order to do that, the \\'wchar_t\\' typed character strings must be decomposed\\nto character sets. This means that if one wchar_t type compound string with \\nASCII and Kanji mixed, for example, is given, each element of the wchar_t\\narray must be checked its corresponding character set based on a bit layout\\nand application environment\\'s locale. In this case if the locale is \\'japanese\\',\\neach wchar_t character will be classified either to iso8859-1, jisx0208 or so.\\n\\nWe need a function to do this. The function must check how many characters\\nfrom the top are the same character set and what the character set is.\\n\\nWe could not find any public X11R5 function to do that and inevitably, used\\nXsi\\'s internal functions to construct that function. The following is the\\nsource code of that function \\'decomposeCharacterSet()\\'.\\n\\n\\n//I18N.h\\n// This may look like C code, but it is really -*- C++ -*-\\n// $Id: I18N.h,v 1.1 1992/01/21 12:05:24 iima Exp iima $\\n\\n#ifndef _I18N_H\\n#define _I18N_H\\n\\n#include <X11/Xlib.h>\\n\\nextern int decomposeCharacterSet(const wchar_t *wc_str,\\t/* IN */\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t int wc_len,\\t\\t/* IN */\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t char *buf,\\t\\t/* OUT */\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t int *buflen,\\t\\t/* IN/OUT */\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t int *scanned_len,\\t/* OUT */\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t char **charset);\\t/* OUT */\\nextern XmString wcharToXmString(const wchar_t *wc_str);\\nextern XmStringCharSet charsetOfWchar(const wchar_t wc);\\n\\n#endif /* _I18N_H */\\n\\n//I18N.cc\\n/* $Id: I18N.cc,v 1.1 1992/01/21 12:05:05 iima Exp $ */\\n\\n#include <stdlib.h>\\n#include <X11/Xlibint.h>\\n#include <Xm/Xm.h>\\n#include \"I18N.h\"\\n\\nextern \"C\" {\\n#include <X11/wchar.h>\\n#define _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset XXX_XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset\\n#define _Xmbfscs XXX_Xmbfscs\\n#define _Xmbctidtocsid XXX_Xmbctidtocsid\\n#include \"Xlocaleint.h\"\\n#undef _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset\\n#undef _Xmbfscs\\n#undef _Xmbctidtocsid\\n    extern int _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset(XLocale, const wchar_t*, int,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t char*, int*, int*, int*);\\n    extern Charset *_Xmbfscs(XLocale, _CSID);\\n    extern _CSID _Xmbctidtocsid(XLocale, _CSID);\\n};\\n\\nint decomposeCharacterSet(const wchar_t *wc_str,/* IN */\\n\\t\\t\\t  int wc_len,\\t\\t/* IN */\\n\\t\\t\\t  char *buf,\\t\\t/* OUT */\\n\\t\\t\\t  int *buf_len,\\t\\t/* IN/OUT */\\n\\t\\t\\t  int *scanned_len,\\t/* OUT */\\n\\t\\t\\t  char **charset)\\t/* OUT */\\n{\\n    XLocale xlocale = _XFallBackConvert();\\n    int ctid;\\n    int status;\\n    Charset *xcharset;\\n    \\n    status = _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset(xlocale, wc_str, wc_len, buf,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t       buf_len, scanned_len, &ctid);\\n    if (status == Success) {\\n\\txcharset = _Xmbfscs(xlocale, _Xmbctidtocsid(xlocale, ctid));\\n\\t*charset = (xcharset) ? xcharset->cs_name : NULL;\\n    }\\n    else\\n\\t*charset = NULL;\\n    return status;\\n}\\n----------------\\n\\nAn included file above, \"Xlocaleint.h\", is also Xsi internal and we copied\\nthe file to the toolkit directory and compiled.\\n\\nA serious issue occured when we tried to compile a toolkit application on\\nour HP machine with its OS version of HP-UX9.01.\\n\\nWhen we tried to link an application based on our toolkit,\\nlink errors occured saying that the following functions are missing:\\n    _Xmbctidtocsid (code)\\n    _Xmbfscs (code)\\n    _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset (code)\\n    _XFallBackConvert (code)\\n\\nWe had used MIT release version of X11R5 and its Xsi implementation until\\nHP-UP9.0 and ran applications successfully. One of the reasons to use Xsi was that\\nbecause HP did not release HP\\'s X11R5 until the OS 9.0 and we had no way to \\nknow how HP\\'s R5 would be implemented. We had hoped Xsi\\'s popularity and used \\nits internal functions. \\n\\nThe HP\\'s linker complains that there are no Xsi internal functions implemented.\\nWe observe from HP\\'s libX11.a, they used some Ximp implementation but we are\\nnot sure if they used MIT\\'s vanilla Ximp version or their own version of Ximp and\\ntherefore, finding just counter part functions in MIT\\'s Ximp for Xsi does not\\nseem to lead us a solution.\\n\\nMy question and goal is to know how we can construct a function like\\n\\'decomposeCharacterset()\\' listed above. Is there any function to check\\ncharacter set of each element of wchar_t type strings depending on locales?\\nIf it is a public function, that is perfect but even if it is not, we\\nwant to use any internal functions in HP\\'s X11R5 as we did for MIT\\'s R5.\\n\\nIn order to render a \\'wchar_t\\' type string, there must be some machinery\\nto judge character sets and that is how the proper fonts are selected for\\nthe string. We have no way to find out that without any HP\\'s X11R5 source \\nfiles. We want to know how we can use that for our goal. \\nAny help or comments would be highly appreciated.\\n\\nI also appreciate if anyone tell me about Ximp treating around this area\\neven if it is not HP\\'s implementation.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\n--\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTakeshi Inoue\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinoue@crd.yokogawa.co.jp\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tYokogawa Electric Corporation\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tOpen Systems Laboratory\\t0422(52)5557\\n'),\n",

This is an excerpt from an article featured in the first issue\\nof the Copt-Net Newsletter :\\n\\nUnder the authority of the Eastern Roman Empire of Constantinople (as opposed\\nto the western empire of Rome), the Patriarchs and Popes of Alexandria played\\nleading roles in  Christian theology.  They were  invited everywhere to speak\\nabout the Christian faith. St. Cyril, Pope of Alexandria, was the head of the\\nEcumenical Council which was held in Ephesus in the year 430 A.D. It was said\\nthat the bishops of the Church of Alexandria did nothing but spend  all their\\ntime in meetings. This leading role, however, did not fare well when politics\\nstarted to intermingle with  Church affairs.  It all started when the Emperor\\nMarcianus interfered with matters of faith in the Church. The response of St.\\nDioscorus, the Pope of Alexandria who was later  exiled, to this interference\\nwas clear: \"You have nothing to do with the Church.\"  These political motives\\nbecame even more  apparent in Chalcedon  in 451, when the Coptic  Church  was\\nunfairly  accused of following  the  teachings of  Eutyches, who believed  in\\nmonophysitism. This  doctrine maintains that the  Lord Jesus Christ  has only\\none nature, the divine, not two natures, the human as well as the divine.\\n\\nThe Coptic  Church   has never  believed  in  monophysitism  the way   it was\\nportrayed in the Council of Chalcedon!  In  that Council, monophysitism meant\\nbelieving in one  nature.  Copts   believe that the Lord   is perfect in  His\\ndivinity,  and He   is perfect in  His humanity,  but  His  divinity  and His\\nhumanity were united in one nature called \"the nature of the incarnate word\",\\nwhich was reiterated by St. Cyril of Alexandria.  Copts, thus, believe in two\\nnatures \"human\" and   \"divine\"  that are   united in   one \"without mingling,\\nwithout confusion, and without alteration\" (from the  declaration of faith at\\nthe end of the Coptic divine liturgy).  These  two  natures \"did not separate\\nfor a moment or the twinkling of an eye\" (also from  the declaration of faith\\nat the end of the Coptic divine liturgy).\\n\\nThe  Coptic Church was  misunderstood in the 5th century  at the  Council  of\\nChalcedon.  Perhaps the Council  understood   the Church correctly, but  they\\nwanted to exile the  Church,   to  isolate it  and to  abolish the  Egyptian,\\nindependent Pope. Despite  all of this,  the Coptic Church  has remained very\\nstrict  and steadfast in its faith.   Whether it was   a  conspiracy from the\\nWestern Churches to exile the Coptic Church  as a  punishment for its refusal\\nto be politically influenced, or whether Pope Dioscurus  didn\\'t  quite go the\\nextra  mile to  make the  point that  Copts  are not  monophysite, the Coptic\\nChurch has always felt a mandate  to reconcile \"semantic\" differences between\\nall  Christian  Churches.   This is   aptly  expressed by the  current  117th\\nsuccessor  of  St. Mark, Pope Shenouda III:  \"To the  Coptic Church, faith is\\nmore  important  than  anything, and   others  must know that  semantics  and\\nterminology are of  little importance to us.\"  Throughout this  century,  the\\nCoptic Church has played  an important role  in the ecumenical  movement. The\\nCoptic Church is one of the founders of the World Council of Churches. It has\\nremained a member of that  council  since 1948 A.D.   The Coptic Church is  a\\nmember  of the all  African Council of Churches  (AACC)  and the  Middle East\\nCouncil of  Churches (MECC).  The Church    plays an  important role   in the\\nChristian   movement   by   conducting dialogues   aiming  at  resolving  the\\ntheological differences with the  Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Presbyterian, and\\nEvangelical Churches.\\n\\n[...]\\n\\nAs a final note, the Oriental Orthodox and Eastren Orthodox did sign\\na common statement of Christology, in which the heresey of Monophysitism\\nwas condemned. So the Coptic Orthodox Church does not believe in\\nMonophysitism.\\n\\nPeace,\\n\\nNabil\\n\\n          .-------------------------------------------------------------.\\n         /  Nabil Ayoub                        ____/   __  /    ____/  /\\n        /  Engine Research Center             /       /   /    /      /\\n       /  Dept. of Mechanical Engineering    ___/    __  /    /      /\\n      /  University of Wisconsin-Madison    /       /   |    /      /\\n     /  Email:ayoub@erctitan.me.wisc.edu  _____/ __/   _|  _____/  /\\n    \\'-------------------------------------------------------------\\'\\n\\n[As I mentioned in a brief apology, the comment quoted above from me\\nis confused.  I appear to say that Nestorius was monophysite.  As\\nAndrew Byler correctly stated it, the Nestorians and monophysites were\\nactually opposite parties.  The point I was making, which Nabil\\nexplains in some detail, is that some groups that have been considered\\nheretical probably aren\\'t.\\n\\nChalcedon was a compromise between two groups, the Alexandrians and\\nAntiochenes.  It adopted language that was intended to be acceptable\\nto moderates in both camps, while ruling out the extremes.  I agree\\nthat there were extremes that were heretical.  However in the course\\nof the complex politics of the time, it appears that some people got\\nrejected who didn\\'t intend heresy, but simply used language that was\\nnot understood or even was mispresented.  And some seem not to have\\njointed in the compromise for reasons other than doctrine.  There are\\ngroups descended from both of the supposedly heretical camps.  This\\nposting discussed the descendants of the Alexandrians.  There are also\\na remaining Nestorians.  Like some of the current so-called\\nmonophysites, there is reason to believe that the current so-called\\nNestorians are not heretical either.  They sheltered Nestorius from\\nwhat they saw as unfair treatment, but claim they did not adopt his\\nheresies, and in fact seem to follow more moderate representatives of\\nthe Antiochene tradition.\\n\\n--clh]\\n'),\n",

To this day, \\nTurkish historic lands remain occupied by the x-Soviet Armenia. In order \\nto cover up the fact of its usurpation of the historic Turkish homeland, \\nwhich is the crux of Turkish political demands, fascist x-Soviet Armenia \\ncontinues its anti-Turkish policy in the following ways:\\n\\n1. x-Soviet Armenia denies the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide\\nin order to shift international public opinion away from its political\\nresponsibility.\\n\\n2. x-Soviet Armenia, employing ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism \\nTriangle, attempts to call into question the veracity of the Turkish \\nGenocide.\\n\\n3. x-Soviet Armenia has also implemented state-sponsored terrorism through\\nthe ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle in an attempt to \\nsilence the Turkish people's vehement demands and protests.\\n\\n4. Using all its human, financial, and governmental resources, x-Soviet\\nArmenia and its tools in the United States attempt to silence through\\nterrorism, bribery and other subversive methods, non-Turkish supporters\\nof the Turkish cause, be they political, governmental and humanitarian.\\n\\nUsing all the aforementioned methods, the x-Soviet Armenian Government \\nis attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community from\\nmaking the Turkish Case a contemporary issue.\\n\\nYet despite the efforts of the x-Soviet Armenian Government and its \\nterrorist and revisionist organizations, in the last decades, thanks \\nto the struggle of those whose closest ones have been systematically \\nexterminated by the Armenians, the international wall of silence on \\nthis issue has begun to collapse, and consequently a number of \\ngovernments and organizations have become supportive of the recognition \\nof the Turkish Genocide.\\n\\nWith the full knowledge that the struggle for the Turkish territorial\\ndemands are still in their initial stages, the Turkish and Kurdish people\\nwill unflaggingly continue in this sacred struggle, therefore the victims\\nof the Turkish Genocide demand:\\n\\n1. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government, as the heirs of the Armenian \\nDictatorship, recognize the Turkish Genocide;\\n\\n2. that x-Soviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish and\\nKurdish people;\\n\\n3. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government make material reparations for \\ntheir heinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide;\\n\\n4. that all world governments, and especially the United States, officially\\nrecognize the Turkish Genocide and Turkish territorial rights and refuse\\nto succumb to all Armenian political pressure;\\n\\n5. that the U.S. Government free itself from the friendly position it \\nhas adopted towards its unreliable ally, x-Soviet Armenia, and officially \\nrecognize the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide as well as be \\nsupportive of the pursuit of Turkish territorial demands;\\n\\n6. that the x-Soviet Republics officially recognize the historical fact \\nof the Turkish Genocide and include the cold-blooded extermination of \\n2.5 million Muslim people in their history books.\\n\\nThe awareness of the Turkish people of the necessity of solidarity in the\\nefforts to pursue the Turkish Cause is seen by the victims of the first \\ngenocide of the 20th century as a positive step. Furthermore, a new \\ngeneration has risen - equipped with a deep sense of commitment, politically\\nmature and conscious, who determinedly pursue the Turkish Cause, through\\nall necessary means, ranging from the political and diplomatic to the \\narmed struggle.

Only one other player since Ruth attained that mark: Cal\\nRipken for his 1984 season.

Special thanks to Brian Evans of Georgia Tech  \\nfor all the help.  \\n\\n--> FTP\\n\\n     COSY_PAK is available by anonymous `ftp\\' from \\nmishna.esys.cwru.edu (Internet No. 129.22.40.23). A sample ftp session \\nis given at the end of this file.\\n\\n**********************************************************************\\n\\n--> Changes in Version 0.9 (update from v0.81 to v0.9)\\n\\n\\tIn this version, we have revised COSY_PAK to take advantage of \\nthe more robust signal processing functions available in Mathematica v2.1.  \\nSince Mathematica 2.1 provides a better  and  working \\nLaplaceTransform and InverseLaplaceTransform functions than \\nMathematica v2.0 did, we adopted them. This has made COSY_PAK \\nsmaller. Thus Brian Evans\\' Signal Processing packages that supported \\nthe LaplaceTransform  and InverseLaplaceTransform functions in the \\nCOSY_PAK v0.81 are no longer needed directly by COSY_PAK v0.9. For \\npower users who  use Signal Processing we still recommend the use of the very  \\nfine  Brian Evans package on Signal Processing (available at \\nthe anonymous  ftp site gauss.eedsp.gatech.edu  or  IP # 130.207.226.24).  On  \\nthe  downside, the disadvantage of this update \\ncan be that Mathematica 2.1 requires more runtime resources than its \\nprevious version. \\n\\n\\n***********************************************************************\\t\\n--> For Mathematica 2.0 users\\n\\t\\n\\tWe have included the LaplaceTransform package from Mathematica 2.1 in  \\nthe directory `For_2.0\\'. Please move all files and directory under For_2.0 into  \\nthe Calculus directory under Mathematica Packages directory. \\n\\n**************************************************************************\\n\\t    \\n--> Introduction\\n   \\n    This is an unsupported release of COSY_PAK - a COntrol SYstems \\nanalysis PAcKage for symbolic control systems analysis using \\nMathematica 2.1. Classical control systems analysis and design methods and some  \\nmodern control systems methods have been implemented in this package. \\n    \\n    This package and the attendant notebooks were developed on a \\nNeXT (TM) computer (a UNIX based workstation). They have been \\nused as a supplementary teaching aid along with  standard control \\nengineering texts (Ogata [1991], Phillips and Harbor [1991]) for \\nundergraduate courses in `Control Engineering I\\' taught at the Systems \\nEngineering Department of CWRU. In addition to the NeXT, they have \\nalso been tested successfully on Apple Macintosh computers (TM), and, \\nIBM PC\\'s (TM) running MS Windows(TM). We would be very much interested \\nto hear from you if you or anybody you know uses this software on \\nplatforms not mentioned above. IBM users however will have to \\nevaluate the notebooks first to visualize the graphics.\\n\\n    Once installed (see below for instructions), this  collection  of  \\nMathematica  packages  can be loaded by any user. Bundled with the \\npackages are many notebooks (\"COSY_Notes\") which demonstrate  \\nthe functionality of these packages. The notebooks follow a plan of \\nmany fine, standard, undergraduate Control Engineering text books \\nlisted in the references. Examples used in these notebooks have \\nbeen collected from the various references given at the end of this \\nfile. The contents of the notebooks in the \"COSY_Notes\" directory are \\ngiven below.\\n   \\n ----------- Begin \"COSY_Notes\" Contents -----------\\n \\n NOTEBOOK FILE NAME: 01_Introduction.ma\\n CHAPTER 1: Introduction to Control Systems\\n\\t\\n\\tSections:  \\n\\t     Analyticity\\n\\t     Poles and Zeros\\n\\t     Signals\\n\\t     Forward Laplace Transforms\\n\\t     Inverse Laplace Transforms\\n\\t     Differential Equation With Zero-Valued Initial Conditions\\n\\t     Differential Equation With Initial Conditions\\n\\t     \\t     \\n -----------\\n \\n NOTEBOOK FILE NAME: 02_Math_Models.ma\\n CHAPTER 2: Mathematical Modeling of Dynamic Systems\\n\\n \\t Sections:  \\n\\t      ODE to State Space  \\n\\t      Linearization of a Nonlinear System of Equations  \\n\\t      State Space to Transfer Function\\n\\t\\t     \\n -----------\\n \\n NOTEBOOK FILE NAME: 03_*_Transient_Response.ma\\n CHAPTER 3: Transient-Response Analysis  \\n            (Chapter split into three sub notebooks because of file\\n\\t     size)\\n\\n\\t NOTEBOOK FILE NAME: 03_1_Transient_Response.ma\\n            \\n\\t    Sections :       \\n\\t      Time Response Analysis  \\n\\t      First order System  \\n\\t      Second Order System  \\n\\t      Third Order and Higher Order Systems\\n\\t      \\n         NOTEBOOK FILE NAME: 03_2_Transient_Response.ma\\n            \\n\\t    Sections  :        \\t      \\n\\t      First Order System (Step Response vs. Time Const)  \\n\\t      \\n\\t      \\n         NOTEBOOK FILE NAME: 03_3_Transient_Response.ma\\n            \\n\\t    Sections  :\\n\\t      Second Order System (Step Response vs. Damping Ratio)  \\n\\t      \\n\\t            \\n -----------\\n\\n NOTEBOOK FILE NAME: 04_Steady_State_Response.ma\\n CHAPTER 4: Steady-State Response\\n \\n         Sections:\\t      \\n\\t      Routh\\'s Stability \\n \\t      Steady-State Error Analysis\\n                \\n -----------\\n\\t\\t\\n NOTEBOOK FILE NAME: 05_Root_Locus.ma\\n CHAPTER 5: Root-Locus Analysis\\n\\n -----------\\n \\n NOTEBOOK FILE NAME: 06_Freq_Response.ma\\n CHAPTER 6: Frequency-Response Analysis\\n\\n         Sections:\\n\\t      Bode Plot Analysis  \\n\\t      Magnitude vs. Phase Plot (Nichols Plot)\\n\\t      Polar Plot  \\n\\t      Nyquist Plot  \\n\\t      Combined Example\\n\\t      \\n -----------\\n \\n NOTEBOOK FILE NAME: 07_State_Space.ma\\n CHAPTER 7: State Space Methods\\n\\n         Sections:\\n\\t      Introduction\\n\\t      State Transition Matrix\\n\\t      Controllability\\n\\t      Observability\\n\\t      Output Controllability\\n\\t      Pole Placement Design \\n\\t      Observer Design\\n\\t      Time Response Using State Space Methods\\n\\n \\n ----------- End Notebook Contents -----------\\n \\n\\n--> Compressed Files\\n\\n        The files that contain  a  complete set of the COSY_PAK v0.9\\npackages and Notebooks for Mathematica are:\\n\\n COSY_PAK_09.tar.Z     \\t\\tcompressed tar file for Unix systems\\n\\t\\n COSY_PAK_09.sit.hqx     \\tcompressed sit file for Macintosh \\n \\t\\t\\t\\tsystems and encoded by BinHex 4.0 \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tformat (requires the   shareware\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t Stuffit file v 1.5.1 or higher). \\n\\t\\n COSY_PAK_IBM_09.zip    \\tzip file for the IBM PC running MS-DOS\\n    \\n     Once expanded the Mathematica files can also be used on \\nMacintosh / IBM PC / Unix systems also.\\n\\n\\n--> Installation of COSY_PAK\\n\\n o In UNIX Command line type the following command:\\n\\n      zcat COSY_PAK_09.tar.Z | tar xvf -\\n\\n o In Macintosh open the .sit.hqx file using the shareware\\n    Stuffit v 1.5.1 or higher.\\n  \\n o In IBM Command line type the following command:\\n\\n      pkunzip -o -d COSY_PAK_IBM_09.zip\\n\\nNOTE: This .zip file was zipped by zip utility v2.0.

Some studies suggest \\nthat early exposure to various infectious diseases is probably beneficial \\nbecause exposure as an adult carries much more risk of morbitity and \\nmortality(mumps, measles. etc.).\\n\\n> -- How often do kids in their first, second and third years fall sick?\\n> How often do they get colds, flus, ear infections?

But many viruses \\nmutate and reexposure to the new strain requires another immune response(\\nnew antibody production).  In addition, antibody levels tend to decline \\nwith time and re-innoculation is needed to keep the antibody levels high.\\nChronic overstimulation of the immune response can lead to immunosupression \\nbut this is rare and very unlikely to occur in children.\\n\\n> -- Does taking antibiotics on a regular basis have any negative long\\n> term effects?\\n\\nYes, chronic use of antibiotics can have an adverse effect on the good \\nbacteria that are supposed to be present in and on the body.  Health effects \\nof this depletion of the good bacteria is a very hotly debated topic in the \\nmedical community with most physicians seeming to discount any health effects \\nof chronic antibiotic use( a view that I do not support).\\n \\n> -- How does one tell if a child is more susceptible to illness than\\n> normal, and what does one do about it?\\n\\nChronic infection in an adult or a child needs to be worked up( in my \\nopinion).  But most physicians feel that chronic infection in a child is \\nnormal because of both exposure and lack of prior immunity to many \\ninfectious diseases.  I do not share this view and there are some \\nphysicians who also suspect that diet plays a big role in infection \\nfrequency and severity.  Exposure to an infectious agent does not have to \\nresult in a severe infection.  A strong immune response can minimize the \\nlength of time needed to deal with the infection as well as the symptoms \\nassociated with the infection.\\n\\n> -- Is there any way to build immunity and resistance?\\n\\nThere are five major nutrients that are responsible for a good strong \\nimmune response to infectious agents.  They are: protein, vitamin C, \\nvitamin A, iron and zinc.  The American diet is not low in protein so this \\nis rarely a problem.  But vitamin A, vitamin C, iron and zinc are often low \\nand this lack of an adequate pool(nutrient reserve) can impair the immune \\nresponse.  Iron is know to be low in most kids(as is vitamin A).  There are \\ndistinct biochemical tests that can be run to check the status of each of \\nthese nutrients in a patient who is having a problem with chronic severe \\ninfection.  Serum ferritin for iron status, dark adaptation for vitamin A \\nstatus, red blood cell zinc for zinc status and leckocyte ascorbate for \\nvitamin C status.  I have attempted to work up posts on these five \\nnutrients and their role in infection for this news group as well as the \\nothers that I participate in.  I can e-mail you what I\\'ve worked up so far.\\nBut my best advice to you is to try to find a physician who recognizes the \\ncritical role that diet plays in the human immune response.  You may also \\nbe able to get help from a nutritionist.  Anyone can call themselves a \\nnutritionist so you have to be very carefull.  You want to find someone(\\nlike myself) who has had some formal training and education in nutrition.\\nMany Ph.D. programs in the U.S. now offer degrees in Nutrition and that\\'s \\nwhat you need to look for.  Some dieticians will also call themselves \\nnutritionists but most dieticians have not had the biochemical training \\nneeded to run specialized nutritional assessment tests.  They are very good \\nfor getting general dietary advice from however.\\n\\n> Any data, information or advice relating to this would be much\\n> appreciated.
